"De los sos ojos tan fuertemientre llorando, 
tornava la cabeça e estávalos catando. 
Vío puertas abiertas e uços sin cañados, 
alcándaras vázias sin pielles e sin mantos 
e sin falcones e sin adtores mudados. 
Sospiró mio Çid, ca mucho avié grandes cuidados. 
Fabló mio Çid bien e tan mesurado: 
""¡grado a ti señor padre, que estás en alto! 
""Esto me an buolto mios enemigos malos.” 
Allí pienssan de aguijar, allí sueltan las riendas. 
A la exida de Bivar ovieron la corneja diestra, 
e entrando a Burgos oviéronla siniestra. 
Meçió mio Çid los ombros y engrameó la tiesta: 
""albricia, Álvar Fáñez, ca echados somos de tierra! 
""mas a grand ondra tornaremos a Castiella.” 

Mio Çid Roy Díaz, por Burgos entróve, 
en sue conpaña sessaenta pendones; 
exien lo veer mugieres e varones, 
burgeses e burgessas, por las finiestras sone, 
plorando de los ojos, tanto avien el dolore. 
De las sus bocas todos dizían una razóne: 
“Dios, qué buen vassallo, si oviesse buen señore!"" 
Conbidar le ien de grado, mas ninguno non osava:
el rey don Alfonsso tanto avie le grand saña.
Una niña de neuf años a ojo se parava: ""
Ya Campeador, en buena çinxiestes espada! 
“ΕΙ rey lo ha vedado, anoch dél entró su carta, 
""con grant recabdo e fuertemientre seellada. 
""Non vos osariemos abrir nin coger por nada; 
""si non, perderiemos los averes e las casas, 
""e aun demás los ojos de las caras. 
""Çid, en el nuestro mal vos non ganades nada; 
""mas el Criador vos vala con todas sus vertudes santas."" 
Esto la niña dixo e tornós pora su cosa. 
Ya lo vede el Çid que del rey non avie gracia. 

La oración fecha, la missa acabada la an, 
salieron de la eglesia, ya quieren cavalgar. 
El Çid a doña Ximena ívala abraçar; 
doña Ximena al Çid la manol va besar, 
llorando de los ojos, que non sabe qué se far. 
E él a las niñas tornólas a catar: 
""a Dios vos acomiendo e al Padre spirital
""agora nos partimos, Dios sabe el ajuntar.”
Llorando de los ojos, que non vidiestres atal, 
assís parten unos d'otros commo la uña de la carne. ","His eyes flooding with bitter tears, the Cid concealed his face, 
He turned his head for one last look at his sweet dwelling place; 
He saw the heavy doors ajar, the postern gate unbolted, 
Bare perches where his skins had hung, and where his falcons molted. 
His heart was sad, he heaved a sigh, in measured words he said: 
""O blessed Father in the sky, Lord of the quick and dead, 
See what my enemies have done to me; the King has been misled."" 
They spurred their mounts, then dropped the reins they had been holding tight, 
Leaving Bivar a bird of hope flew singing on their right, 
But near Burgos a baleful crow hove leftward into sight. 
The Cid looked up, he grimly shrugged and turned his head aside, 
""Take heart with me Alvar, old friend,"" these words he proudly cried, 
""While we are now cast from the land where all our kin reside, 
Castile will yet hail our return, or claim us when we've died."" 
The Cid rode into Burgos then with sixty lances strong, 
And men and women sallied forth to greet the passing throng, 
While other townsfolk gazed at them from windows all along, 
They wept in anguish at the sight and cried with one accord: 
""God, what a vassal he would make, if he had a good lord!"" 
They gladly would have sheltered him, but dared not disregard 
The edict that the King had sent, which all of them abhorred. 

A little girl of nine came out to where the Cid's horse stood, 
""O Campeador of honored sword, we'd open if we could; 
Last night the king's decree arrived closing our doors to you, 
By herald and well sealed it came to prove its message true, 
And so we dare not open up despite our angry cries, 
We'd lose our homes and our estates, even our very eyes. 
Cid, do not trespass on our plight, if by mischance you should, 
Then you would wrong us grievously, and do yourself no good, 
But God attend you where you go, this much we all implore!"" 
So spoke the girl and went inside and locked the heavy door; 
The Cid then knew his royal sire would favor him no more. 

The prayer and mass were spoken to start them on their way,
They left the church and mounted, but how they longed to stay, 
The Cid embraced Jimena, his hand that round her lay 
She lifted gently to her lips, and sobbed in her dismay, 
He turned and kissed his daughters, and to them softly said: 
""May God the Father guard you, His grace upon you shed, 
At last the time to leave has come, the parting that I dread. 
God willing we will meet again, but now our travails start.' 
They wiped the tears away once more, but still grieved in the heart, 
Then like nail that leaves the flesh, they tore themselves apart
","From your eyes so strong while crying,
He turned his head and was tasting them.
I saw open doors and uços without ravines,
empty alcándars without skins and without cloaks
and without falcons and without changed adtors.
My Çid sighed, I took great care.
My Çid spoke well and so measured:
""Thank you sir father, you are on high!
""This has brought me back, my evil enemies.""
There they think of prodding, there they let go of the reins.
At Bivar's exit they heard the right-handed crow,
and entering Burgos they saw the sinister thing.
My Çid shook his shoulders and greased the pot:
""Albricia, Álvar Fáñez, we are fallen from the ground!
""but at great wave we will return to Castiella.""

My Çid Roy Díaz, by Burgos entranceve,
in his company sixty banners;
Exien see it women and men,
burgesses and burgesses, for the sone holidays,
crying out of the eyes, so much pain relief.
From their mouths everyone said a reason:
“God, what a good vassal, si oviesse good sir!”
He welcomed him willingly, but no one dared:
King Don Alfonsso loved him so much.
A new-year-old girl stopped by the eye: ""
Already Campeador, in good çinxiestes sword!
“The king has forbidden him, last night his letter came in,
""with grant collected and strongly sealed.
""We wouldn't dare open or take it for anything;
""If not, we would lose the birds and the houses,
""and even more the eyes of the faces.
""Çid, in our evil you gain nothing;
""but the Creator values ​​you with all his holy virtues.""
This the girl said and went back to her thing.
The Çid already sees that the king has no favor.

The prayer date, the mass finished the an,
They left the church, they already want to ride.
El Çid hugged Doña Ximena;
Doña Ximena al Çid the hand is going to kiss,
crying from his eyes, he doesn't know what he's doing.
And he took the girls back to taste:
""I commend you to God and to the spiritual Father
""Now we are parting, God knows how to put it together.""
Crying from the eyes, that you don't see atal,
Thus they split from each other like the nail of flesh.",,John A. Crow,med
"¡Merced, ya rey señor por amor de caridad! 
La rencura mayor non se me puede olbidar, 
oídme toda la cort e pésevos de mio mal;
Ifantes de Carrión quem desondraron tan mal; 
a menos de riebtos no los puedo dexar.' 
Dezid ¿qué vos merecí ifantes de Carrión
en juego o en vero o en alguna razón? 
Aquí lo mejoraré a juvizio de la cort. 
¿A quém descubriestes las telas del coraçón? 
A la salida de Valencia mis fijas vos di yo,
con muy grand ondrae averes a nombre; 
cuando las non queriedes ya canes traidores, 
¿por qué las sacávades de Valencia sus honores?
 ¿A qué las firiestes a cinchas e a espolones? 
Solas las dexastes en el robredo de Corpes,
a las bestias fieras e a las aves del mont. 
Por quanto les fiziestes menos valedes vos. 
Si non recudedes véalo esta cort. 

¡E eres fermoso mas mal varragán! 
¿Lengua sin manos quómo osas fablar? 
Di, Ferrando otorga esta razón: 
¿None te viene en miente en Valencia lo del león, 
quando durmió mio Çid y el león se desató? 
É tú, Ferrando ¿qué fizist con el pavor? 
¡Metistet tras el escaño de mío Çid el Campeador! 
Metistet, Ferrando por o menos vales oy. 
Nos cercamos el escaño por curiar nuestro señor, 
fasta do despertó mio Çid el que Valencia gañó; 
levantós del escaño e fos poral león; 
el león premió la cabeça a mio Çid esperó, 
dexósle prender al cuello e a la red le metió. 
Quando se tornó el buen Campeador, 
a sos vasallos viólos aderredor; 
demandó por sos yernos ¡ninguno non falló! 
Riébtot el cuerpo por malo e por traidor. 

“Oíd que vos digo, ifantes de Carrione: 
""""esta lid en Toledo la fiziérades, mas non quisiestes vose.""""
""""Estos tres cava'leros de mio Çid el Campeadore 
""""yo los adux a salvo a tierras de Carrione. 
'Aved vuestro derecho, tuerto non querades vose, 
“ca qui tuerto quisiere fazer, mal gelo vedaré yove, 
""""en todo myo reyno non avrá buena sabore,' 
Yas les va pesando a ifantes de Carrione. 

Los fideles y el rey enseñaron los mojones,
librávanse del campo todos a derredor.
Bien gelo demostraron a todos seys commo son
que por í serié vencido qui saliesse del mojón. 
Todos las yentes esconbraron a derredor, 
de seys astas de lanças que non llegassen al mojón. 

Sorteávanles el campo, ya les partién el sol, 
salién los fideles de medio ellos cara por cara son; 
desí vinién los de mio Çid a ifantes de Carrión
e ifantes de Carrión a los del Campeador; 
cada uno dellos mientes tiene al so. 
Abraçan los escudos delant los coraçones
enclinavan las caras sobre los arzones
batién los cavallos con los espolones, 
tembrar querié la tierra dond eran movedores.
Cada uno dellos mientes tiénet al so; 
todos tres por tres ya juntados son: 
cuédanse que essora cadrán muertos los aderredor. 

Per Vermudoz, el que antes rebtó, 
con Ferránt Gonçálvez de cara se juntó 
firiensse en los escudos sin todo pavor. 
Ferrán Gonçalvez a don Pero el escudol passó, 
prísol en vázio, en carne nol tomó, 
bien en dos logares el astil le quebró. 
Firme estido Per Vermudoz, por esso nos encamó; 
un colpe recibiera, mas otro firió: 
crebantó la bloca del escudo, apart gela echó, 
passógelo todo, que nada nol valió. 
Metiól la lança por los pechos, cerca del coraçon; 
tres dobles de loriga teníe Fernando, aquestol prestó. 
Las dos le desmanchan e la tercera fincó: 
el belmez con la camisa e con la guarnizón
de dentro en la carne una mano gela metió; 
por la boca afuera la sángrel salió; 
crebaronle las çinchas, ninguna nol ovo pro, 
por la copla del cavallo en tierra lo echó. 
Assí lo tenién las yentes que mal ferido es de muort. 
En elle dexó la lança e mano al espada metió, 
quando lo vido Ferrán Gonçalvez, conuvo a Tizón; 
antes que el colpe esperasse dixo: """"vençudo so"""". 
Atorgaróngelo los fideles, Per Vermudos le dexó. 

Don Martino e Diag Gonçalvez firiéronse de las lanças, 
tales foron los colpes que les crebaron amas. 
Martín Antolínez mano metió al espada, 
relumbra tod el campo, tanto es linpia e clara; 
diol un colpe, de traviéssol tomava: 
el casco de somo apart gelo echava, 
las moncluras del yelmo todas gelas cortava, 
allá levó el almófar, fata la cofia llegava, 
la cofia e el almófar todo gelo levava, 
ráxol los pelos de la cabeça, bien a la carne llegava;
 lo uno cayó en el campo e lo al suso fincava.

Quando este colpe a ferido Colada la preciada, 
vido Díag Gonçálvez que no escaparié con el alma; 
bolvió la rienda al cavallo por tornase de cara, 
espada tiene en mano mas no la ensayava. 
Essora Martín Antolínez recibiól con el espada, 
un cólpel dió de llano con lo agudo nol tomava. 
Essora el ifante tant grandes vozes dava: 
""""¡Valme, Dios glorioso, señor, cúriam deste espada!"""" 
El cavallo asorrienda, e mesurándol del espada. 
Sacól del mojón; don Martino en el camp fincava. 

Los dos han arrancado; dirévos de Muño Gustioz, 
con Anssuor Gonçálvez cómmo se adobó. 
Firiénsse en los escudos unos tan grandes colpes. 
Anssuor Gonçálvez, forçudo e de valor, 
firió en el escudo a don Muño Gustioz, 
tras el escudo falssole la guarnizón;
en vázio fue la lança ca en carne nol tomó. 
Este colpe fecho, otro dió Muño Gustioz: 
por medio de la bloca, el escúdol crebantó; 
nol pudo guarir, falssóle la guarnizón, 
apart le priso, que non cab al coraçón 
metiól por la carne adentro la lança con el pendón, 
de la otra part una braça gela echó. 
con él dió una tuerta, de la siella lo encamó, 
al tirar de la lança en tierra lo echó; 
vermejo salió el astil, e la lança y el pendón. 
Todos se cuedan que ferido es de muort. 
La lança recombró e sobrél se paró; 
dixo Gonçalvo Anssuórez: """"¡Nol firgades, por Dios! 
""""vençudo es el campo, quando esto se acabó!"""" ","Justice and mercy, my Lord the King, I beseech you of your grace! 
I have yet a grievance left behind, which nothing can efface. 
Let all men present in the court attend and judge the case, 
Listen to what these Counts have done and pity my disgrace. 
Dishonored as I find myself, I cannot be so base, 
But here before I leave them, to defy them to their face. 
Say, Counts, how had I so deserved, in earnest or in jest, 
Or on whatever plea you can defend it at your best, 
That you should rend and tear the heartstrings from my breast? 

I gave you at Valencia my daughters in your hand, 
I gave you wealth and honors, and treasure at command: 
Had you been weary of them, to cover your neglect, 
You might have left them with me, in honor and respect. 
Why did you take them from me, dogs and traitors that you were? 
In the forest of Corpes, why did you strip them there? 
Why did you mangle them with whips?
Why did you leave them bare 
To the vultures and to the wolves, and to the wintry air?
The court will hear your answer, and judge what you have done 
I say your name and honor henceforth are lost and gone. 

You are so tall and handsome, but cowardly and weak, 
Thou tongue without a hand, how can you dare to speak? 
There's the story of the lion should never be forgot, 
Now let us hear, Fernando, what answer have you got? 
The Cid was sleeping in his chair, with all his knights around, 
The cry went forth along the hall. """"The lion is unbound!” 
What did you do, Fernando, like the coward that you were? 
You slunk behind the noble Cid, and crouched beneath his chair. 
We pressed around the sleeping man to shield our Lord from harm, 
Till the good Cid awoke at last; he rose without alarm; 
He went to meet the lion with his mantle on his arm. 
The lion was abashed and shamed the noble Cid to meet, 
He bowed his mane down to the earth, his muzzle at his feet. 
The Cid then by his neck and mane withdrew him to his den, 
He closed the cage and then came back into the hall again; 
He found his knights, his vassals, and all his valiant men; 
He asked about his sons-in-law, they were neither of them there. 
I defy you for a coward and the weakling that you were. 

""Hear this, my Lords of Carrión! Attend to what I say! 
You should have fought this battle upon a former day, 
When we were at Toledo, but you would not agree; 
And now the noble Cid has sent these stalwart champions three, 
To fight in ancient Carrión, escorted here by me. 
Be valiant in your fight today, do no foul play or wrong; 
If any man attempt it, he shall not triumph long; 
He never shall have rest or peace within my kingdom more."""" 
The faithless Lords of Carrión are now repenting sore; 
The Heralds and the King himself are foremost in the place, 
They clear away the people from the guarded middle space; 
They measure off the boundaries, the barriers they fix, 
They point them out in order, and explain to all the six: 
""""If you are forced beyond the line where they are marked and traced, 
You shall be held as conquered and beaten and disgraced."""" 
Six lances length on either side an open space is laid, They share the field between them, the sunshine and the shade. 
Their office is performed, and from the battle space 
The heralds now are all withdrawn and leave them face to face. 
Here stand the warriors of the Cid, that noble champion, 
Opposing on the other side, the Lords of Carrión. 
Earnestly their minds are fixed each one upon his foe; 
And then apace they take their place, anon the trumpets blow; 
They stir their horses with the spur, they lay their lances low, 
They hold their shields before their breasts, behind their saddle bow. 
The skies are overcast above, the earth trembles below. 
The people stand in silence now, all gazing on the show; 
Bermúdez the first challenger first into combat sped, 
He met Ferrán González, and charged him head to head; 
They rush together with such rage that all men count them dead. 
They strike each other on the shield, and with no thought of dread. 
Ferrán González with his lance pierced through the shield outright, 
It passed Bermúdez on the side, his flesh it did not bite. 
The wooden spear was snapped in twain, Bermúdez sat upright, 
He neither flinched nor swerved, like a true perfect knight. 
A good stroke he received, but a better he had given; 
He struck the shield upon the boss, in sunder it is riven, 
Then on and deep in Ferrán's breast the lance's point is driven, 
Far into his breast-plate it went, and nothing would avail; 
Fernando wore two breast-plates, besides his coat-of-mail; 
The two are riven in sunder, the third stood him in stead, 
The mail sunk in his breast, the mail and the spear-head, 
The blood was spurting from his mouth in streams of gory red. 
The blow had snapped his girdle, also his saddle girth, 
It knocked him from his charger's back, and cast him to the earth. 
The people think that he is dead as he lies on the sand; 
Bermúdez put his land aside and took his sword in hand. 
Ferrán González knew the blade which he had worn of old, 
Before the mighty blow came down, he yielded and cried, ""Hold!""

Antolínez and Diego then charged and helmets flashed, 
Their spears were shivered with the shock, so furiously they clashed. 
Antolínez drew forth the blade which Diego once had worn, 
Eagerly he aimed the blow for the vengeance he had sworn, 
Right through Diego's helm the blade's sharp edge has borne, 
The crest and helm are lopped away, the coif and hair are shorne. 
He stood astounded with the stroke, now trembling and forlorn, 
He waved his sword above his head, he made a piteous cry, 
""""O save me from that blade, Almighty Lord on high!"""" 
Antolínez came fiercely on to give the fatal stroke, 
Diego's courser reared upright, and through the barrier broke; 
Antolínez has won the bout, although his blow has missed, 
He drove Diego from the field, and stands within the list. 
I tell you next of Muño Gustioz, two combats now are done; 
How he fought Assur González, you shall hear of this anon. 
Assur González was a bold, a fierce and hardy knight, 
He rode at Muño Gustioz, with all his force and might; 
He struck the shield and pierced it through, but then the point came wide, 
It passed around Muño Gustioz, betwixt his arm and side; 
Sternly, like a practiced knight, brave Muño met him there, 
His lance he levelled steadfastly, and through the shield hit bare; 
He bore the point into his breast, but just outside the heart; 
It took him through the body, but in no mortal part; 
The shaft stood out behind his back a good cloth-yard and more; 
The pennon and the point were dripping down with gore, 
Muño still clenched his spear in hand, he passed and forced it round, 
He wrenched him from the saddle, and cast him to the ground. 
His horse sprang forward with the spur, he plucked the spear away, 
He wheeled and came around again to pierce him where he lay. 
Then Cried Gonzalo Asurez, """"For God's sake spare my son! 
The other two have yielded, the field is fought and won!"""" ","Mercy, now king, sir, for the love of charity!
I cannot forget the greatest resentment,
Hear me all the court and regret my bad;
Ifantes of Carrión who unraveled so badly;
unless I can't leave them.'
Dezid, what did you deserve ifantes de Carrión
in play or in vero or in some reason?
Here I will improve it to juvizio de la cort.
Why did you discover the fabrics of the heart?
At the exit from Valencia, I gave my fixes,
with very grand ondrae averes to name;
when you don't love them and become traitors,
Why do Valencia's sacávades honor them?
 Why do you give them girths and spurs?
You left them alone in the Corpes robredo,
to the fierce beasts and to the birds of the mountain.
The more you act on them, the less valuable you are.
If you don't remember, watch it this short.

And you are beautiful but bad varragán!
Tongue without hands, how dare you speak?
Say, Ferrando grants this reason:
Doesn't anyone remember the lion in Valencia?
When did my Çid sleep and the lion was unleashed?
You, Ferrando, what are you doing with terror?
Get behind my Çid the Champion's seat!
Metistet, Ferrando for or less you are worth oy.
We surround the seat to guard our lord,
until my Çid woke up, the one Valencia won;
you rose from the seat and foaled the lion;
The lion rewarded my head, Çid waited,
He let him grab him by the neck and put him in the net.
When the good Campeador turned,
He saw his vassals around him;
He sued for his sons-in-law, none of them failed!
Riébtot the body as evil and as a traitor.

“Hear what I say, ifantes of Carrione:
""""this fight in Toledo is the fiziérades, but you did not want to.""""
""""These three knights of my Çid the Champion
""""I brought them safely to the lands of Carrione.
'Ave your right, one-eyed non querades vose,
“Ca qui tuerto wishes to do, bad gelo I will veda yove,
""""in all my kingdom I will not taste good,'
It's already weighing on Carrione's ifantes.

The faithful and the king showed the milestones,
Everyone around gets rid of the field.
Well they showed everyone how they are
that by him he would be defeated whoever left the boundary.
All the people gathered around,
of six spear shafts that did not reach the milestone.

They raffled off the field, they already divided the sun,
The faithful come out of the middle, face to face;
This is how my Çid's came to the Ifantes of Carrión
and ifantes of Carrión to those of the Campeador;
each one of them lies has to his.
They embrace the shields in front of the hearts
They bow their faces over the pommels
beat the horses with the spurs,
I wanted to shake the earth where they were movers.
Each one of them lies to the other;
all three by three already put together are:
Remember that those around you will be dying dead.

Per Vermudoz, the one who rebounded before,
with Ferránt Gonçálvez on his face he got together
firiense on the shields without any fear.
Ferrán Gonçalvez to Don But the shield passed,
prísol in vázio, in meat nol took,
Well in two places the shaft broke him.
Firm state Per Vermudoz, that's why he bedded us;
one colpe received, but another fired:
He created the block of the shield, threw it aside,
Pass it all, nothing was worth it.
He stuck the spear through her breasts, close to her heart;
Fernando had three doubles of loriga, which he lent.
The two remove stains from the third property:
the belmez with the shirt and with the garrison
From within the flesh a cold hand entered;
blood came out through the mouth;
They created his cinchas, none of them ovo pro,
For the song of the horse he threw it to the ground.
This is how the people have it that a badly injured person is dead.
In it he left the spear and put the sword in his hand,
When Ferrán Gonçalvez saw it, he took Tizón;
Before the colpe expected he said: """"vençudo so"""".
Atorgaróngelo los fideles, Per Vermudos left him.

Don Martino and Diag Gonçalvez took flight from the lances,
such caused the colpes that they believed their masters.
Martín Antolínez hand put the sword,
The entire field shines, so much is it clean and clear;
diol un colpe, from traviessol tomava:
the helmet of somo apart geloechava,
the moncluras of the helmet all gelas Cortava,
There he lifted the cowl, but the cap arrived,
the cap and the couch all gelo levava,
raxol the hairs of the head, reaching the flesh well;
 The one fell in the field and the other on the farm.

When this colpe has injured Colada the precious one,
Díag Gonçálvez saw that I would not escape with my soul;
He reined the horse back to turn its face,
He has a sword in his hand but does not try it.
Essora Martín Antolínez received him with the sword,
a colpel hit plain with the sharp nol tomava.
Essora el ifante so many great voices dava:
""""Hold me, glorious God, sir, cure me of this sword!""""
The horse surprises, and measures the sword.
Sacól of the cairn; Don Martino at Camp Fincava.

Both have started; dirévos by Muño Gustioz,
with Anssuor Gonçálvez how it was marinated.
Such large colpes appear on the shields.
Anssuor Gonçálvez, strong and brave,
He wounded Don Muño Gustioz on the shield,
behind the shield falssole the garrison;
In vazio was the lança ca en carne nol took.
This colpe was done, another Muño Gustioz gave:
through the block, the shield crebanted;
He could not hide, he falsified the garnizón,
Away from the prison, which does not fit the heart
He put the spear with the banner through the flesh,
From the other side he threw a fat arm.
with him he gave him a one-eyed, from the chair he put him to bed,
When he pulled the lance on the ground he threw it;
The shaft, the lance and the banner came out vermejo.
Everyone knows that the wound is due to death.
The lance bounced back and stopped on it;

"Sant Migael de la Tunba es un grand monesterio, 
el mar lo cerca todo, elli iaze en medio: 
El logar perigloso, do sufren grand lazerio 
los monges que hi viven en essi cimiterio. 

En esti monesterio que avemos nomnado, 
avie de buenos monges buen convento provado, 
altar de la Gloriosa rico e mui onrrado, 
en él rica imagen de precio mui granado, 

estava la imagen en su trono posada, 
so fijo en sus brazos, cosa es costumnada 
los reis redor ella, sedie bien compannada, 
como rica reina de Dios santificada. ","San Miguel de la Tumba is a convent vast and wide; 
The sea encircles it around, and groans on every side; 
It is a wild and dangerous place, and many woes betide 
The monks who in that burial-place in penitence abide. 

Within those dark monastic walls, amid the ocean flood, 
Of pious, fasting monks there dwelt a holy brotherhood; 
To the Madonna's glory there an altar high was placed, 
And a rich and costly image the sacred altar graced. 

Exalted high upon a throne, the Virgin Mother smiled, 
And, as the custom is, she held within her arms the Child: 
The kings and wise men of the East were kneeling by her side: 

Attended was she like a queen whom God had sanctified. ","Sant Migael de la Tunba is a great monastery,
The sea surrounds everything, it lies in the middle:
The periglossal logar, where they suffer great lazerio
the monks who live in this cemetery.

In this monastery that we have named,
avie of good monks, good private convent,
altar of the Glorious rich and very honored,
in it rich image of very granado price,

The image was perched on its throne,
I stay fixed in his arms, which is customary
The kings surrounded her, she was well accompanied,
as a rich, sanctified queen of God.",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,med
"Colgava delant ella un buen aventadero, 
en el seglar lenguage dízenli moscadero: 
De alas de pavones lo fizo el obrero, 
luzie como estrellas semejant de luzero. 

Cadió rayo del cielo por los graves peccados, 
ençendió la eglesia de todos quatro cabos, 
quemó todos los libros e los pannos sagrados, 
por pocco que los monges que non foron quemados. 
","Descending low before her face a screen of feathers hung,- 
A moscader, or fan for flies, 't is called in vulgar tongue; 
From the feathers of the peacock's wing 't was fashioned bright and fair, 
And glistened like the heaven above when all its stars are there. 

It chanced that, for the people's sins, fell the lightning's blasting stroke: 
Forth from all four the sacred walls the flames consuming broke: 
The sacred robes were all consumed, missal and holy book; 
And hardly with their lives the monks their crumbling walls forsook. ","There was a good window hanging in front of her,
In the secular language they say:
The worker made it from the wings of peacocks,
I shine like bright stars.

Lightning fell from heaven for grave sins,
He lit the church of all four corners,
He burned all the books and sacred books,
just as the monks who were not burned were burned.

"Maguer que fue el fuego tan fuert e tan quemant, 
nin plegó a la duenna, nin plegó al ifant, 
nin plegó al flabello que colgava delant, 
nin li fizo de danno un dinero pesant. 

Nin ardió la imagen, nin ardió el flabello, 
nin prisieron de danno quanto val un cabello, 
solamiente el fumo non se llegó a ello, 
nin nució mas que nuzo io al obispo don Tello. 

Continens e contentum, fue todo astragado, 
tornó todo carbones, fo todo asolado: 
Mas redor de la imagen quanto es un estado, 
non fizo mal el fuego, ca non era osado. 

Esto tovieron todos por fiera maravella, 
que nin fumo nin fuego non se llegó a ella, 
que sedie el flabello más claro que estrella, 
el ninno mui fermoso, formosa la ponzella. 
La Virgo benedicta reina general,
 como libró su toca de esti fuego tal, 
asín libra sus siervos del fuego perennal, 
Liévalos a la gloria do nunqua vean mal.","But though the desolating flame raged fearfully and wild, 
It did not reach the Virgin Queen, it did not reach the Child; 
It did not reach the feathery screen before her face that shone, 
Nor injure in a farthing's worth the image or the throne. 

The image it did not consume, it did not burn the screen; 
Even in the value of a hair they were not hurt, I ween: 
Not even the smoke did reach them, nor injure more the shrine 
Than the bishop hight Don Tello has been hurt by hand of mine.
 
""Continuens et contentum,”—all was in ruins laid; 
A heap of smouldering embers that holy pile was made: 
But where the sacred image sat, a fathom's length around, 
The raging flame dared not approach the consecrated ground. 

It was a wondrous miracle to those that thither came, 
That the image of the Virgin was safe from smoke and flame,- 
That brighter than the brightest star appeared the feathery screen,- 
And seated there the Child still fair, and fair the Virgin Queen. 
The Virgin Queen, the sanctified, who from an earthly flame 
Preserved the robes that pious hands had hung around her frame, 
Thus from an ever-burning fire her servants shall deliver, 
And lead them to that high abode where the good are blessed for ever. ","Maguer that the fire was so strong and so burning,
nin folded the duenna, nin folded the ifant,
nor folded the flabello that hung in front,
He didn't give him any money at all.

Neither did the image burn, nor did the flag burn,
They did not imprison anything worth a hair,
Only the smoke didn't come to it,
No one was born except that he was given to Bishop Don Tello.

Continens e contentum, everything was destroyed,
He turned everything into coals, fo everything desolate:
More around the image how much is a state,
He didn't make the fire badly, he wasn't daring.

Everyone took this as a fierce wonder,
that neither smoke nor fire could reach it,
May the flag be brighter than a star,
The child is very beautiful, the ponzella is beautiful.
The blessed Virgo queen general,
 how he freed his hat from this fire,
Thus he frees his servants from the everlasting fire,
Send them to the glory where they never see evil.",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,med
"El mes era de mayo, un tiempo glorïoso, 
quando fazen las aves un solaz deleitoso, 
son vestidos los prados de vestido fremoso, 
da suspiros la duenna, la que non ha esposo. 

Tiempo dolce e sabroso bastir casamientos, 
por ca lo tempran las flores e los sabrosos vientos, 
cantan las donzelletas, son muchas a convientos, 
fazen unas a otras buenos pronunciamentos. 

Caen en el verano las bonas rociadas, 
entran en flor las miesses ca son ya espigadas, 
azen las duenyas triscas en camisas delgadas: 
¡Entón casan algunos que pues messan las barvas! 

Andan moças y viejas cobiertas en amores, 
van coger por la sieta a los prados las flores, 
dizen unas a otras:-""¡Bonos son los amores!"" 
Y aquellos plus tiernos tienense por mejores. 

Los días son grandes, los campos reverdidos, 
son los passariellos del mal pelo exidos, 
los távanos que muerden non son aún venidos, 
luchan los monagones en bragas sen vestidos. ","In the tender month of May in the bright and shining spring, 
When the nightingale and thrush on the budding branches sing, 
When the meadows and the hillocks don their robes of velvet green, 
There comes a beauteous maiden both graceful and serene. 
The magic of the maytide calls to lovers with the song 
Of zephyrs rustling through the flowers, for to their hearts belong 
The season's fairest treasure. And in the fields of heather 
Like daisies woven in a wreath, young maidens sing together. 
A gentle rain begins to fall, the crystal droplets nourish 
The tender herb, that rich with grain, at harvest time shall flourish. 
Beneath the arching bowers there is a wedding celebration 
The ladies crowned with garlands gay all dance in jubilation. 
This gladsome time, o'er young and old, doth cast a wondrous spell, 
And lovers pass the hours away within the flowering dell. 
In sweet repose their hearts are filled with love's strange mysteries, 
And thoughts of love, like petals blown, are borne upon the breeze. 
The sun pours forth his splendor, on his languorous journey goes 
To touch the nestlings' dewy wings, to kiss the christened rose. 
As though enchanted angry hornets stay their venomed sting, 
While shouts of boys at frolicksome play, the fields are echoing. 
And touched by fragrant orchard breath and maytide's fair display, 
The noble Alexander proclaimed a holiday. 
The fairest ladies and their lords, adorned in raiment bright, 
Unto his palace made resort, to share their king's delight. ","The month was May, a glorious time,
when the birds make a delightful solace,
The meadows are dressed in a frosty dress,
The duenna sighs, she who has no husband.

Sweet and tasty time for weddings,
because the flowers and the tasty winds bring it early,
the little girls sing, there are many of them in convents,
make good pronouncements to each other.

Good dews fall in the summer,
The crops come into flower and are already in bloom,
azen the sad duenyas in thin shirts:
Then some get married and then they mess up the boats!

Young girls and old women walk covered in love,
They are going to pick the flowers in the meadows,
They say to each other: - ""Bonuses are loves!""
And those that are more tender are considered better.

The days are great, the fields are green,
They are the passariellos of the bad hair exidos,
the sandflies that bite are not yet come,
The monagones fight in panties and dresses.",,Katharine E. Strathdee,med
"Del qu' olvyda la muger te diré la fazaña: 
sy vieres que es burla, dyme otra tan maña. 
Era don Pitas Pajas, un pyntor de Bretaña; 
casó con muger moça, pagávas' de conpaña. 

Antes del mes cunplido dixo él: “Nostra dona, 
""yo volo yr a Frandes, portaré muyta dona."" 
Ella diz': ""Monssner, andés en ora bona; 
""non olvidés casa vostra nin la mía presona.” 

Dixol' don Pitas Payas: ""Doña de fermosura, 
""yo volo fer en vos una bona fygura. 
""porque seades guardada de toda altra locura."" 
Ella diz': ""Monssener, fazet vuestra mesura.” 

Pyntol' so el onbligo un pequeño cordero. 
Fuerse don Pytas Pajas a ser novo mercadero. 
Tardó allá dos anos, muncho fue tardinero, 
Façías' le a la dona un mes año entero. 

Como era la moça nuevamente casada, 
avíe con su marido fecha poca morada; 
tomó un entendedor e pobló la posada, 
desifízos' el cordero, que dél non fynca nada. 

Quando ella oyó que venía el pyntor, 
muy de prisa enbió por el entendedor; 
díxole que le pyntase, como podiesse mejor, 
en aquel logar mesmo un cordero menor. 

Pyntóle con la gran priessa un eguado carnero 
conplido de cabeça, con todo su apero; 
luego en ese día vino el menssajero: 
que ya don Pytas Pajas desta venía çertero. 


Quando fue el pyntor ya de Frandes venido, 
ffue de la su muger con desdén resçebido; 
desque en el palaçio ya con ella estido, 
la señal que l' feziera non le echó en olvido. 

Dixo don Pytas Pajas: ""Madona, sy vos plaz' 
""mostratme la figura e ¡aiam' buen solaz!” 
Diz' la muger: “Monseñer, vos mesmo la catat: 
""fey y ardidamente todo lo que vollaz."" 

Cató don Pytas Pajas el sobredicho lugar, 
e vydo grand carnero con armas de prestar. 
""Cómo, madona, es esto o como pode estar, 
""que yo pynté corder, e trobo este manjar?"" 

Como en este fecho es syenpre la muger 
sotil e malsabyda, diz': “¿Cómo, monsseñer, 
""en dos anos petid corder non se fer carner? 
""Veniésedes tenplano: trobaríades corder.” 

Por ende te castiga, non dexea lo que pides: 
non seas Pytas Pamjas, para otro non errides. 
Con dezires fermosos a la mujer conbydes: 
desque telo prometa, guarda non lo olvides. 

Pedro levanta la lyebre e la mueve del covil, 
non la sygue nin la toma, faz' como caçador vyl; 
otro Pedro que la sygue e la corre más sotil, 
tómala; esto contesçe a caçadores mill. 

Dyz' la muger entre dientes: ""Otro Pedro es aqueste. 
""Más garçón e más ardit, que 'l primero que ameste: 
""el primero apost déste non vale más que un feste, 
""con aqueste a por éste faré yo, ¡sy Dios me preste!"" 

Otrosí quando vyeres a quien usa con ella, 
quier sea suyo o non, fáblale por amor della; 
sy podieres, dal' algo, non le ayas querella: 
ca estas cosas pueden a la mujer traella.

que l' dyeres, servirt' la lealmente, fará lo que quisieres, 
fará por los dineros todo quanto pidieres: 
que poco o que much, dal' cadaque podieres. 
","""I'll tell you what befell a man who would not watch his dame: 
'Twill pay you well to give close heed lest you be served the same: 
A famous Breton painter once, Sir Peter Pious, came 
To wed a young and lusty girl whose passion was aflame. 

""Yet hardly was he wed a month before the artist quoth, 
'I must away to Flanders, love, but upon my oath 
I swear, I'll bring you back some gift.' His wife replied, 'I'm loath 
To see you leave my bed and board; pray, sir, remember both.' 

""Thereat Sir Peter Pious said, 'But first, my lady fair, 
Do let me paint upon your skin a picture quaint and rare, 
A picture that will keep you chaste when you behold it there.' 
Said she, 'Go work your will on me, forsooth you see me bare.' 

""Below her belly-button, then, her drew with famous skill 
The image of the Lamb of God, and sketched it with a will, 
But when he left he stayed two years his business to fulfill- 
Now how could any girl be true with all that time to kill! 

""Her loneliness was hardly equalled, nor was the longing feigned. 
But paradise though lost was sequelled by paradise regained 
Because she found a sprightly lad who rubbed her where she pained, 
Yet rubbed the Lamb of God so hard that not a trace remained. 

""Then came the news her painter man was coming home at last, 
So straight the damsel called the lad who'd been her sole repast 
And ordered him to paint on her another lamb full fast 
Right on that very self-same spot the Lamb of God was cast. 

""He wrought upon her mightily but drew a ram with horns, 
Great prongs they were that sprouted out like sharp and piercing thorns 
(One other detail, too, he made which every ram adorns); 
'Twas scarcely done ere Pious entered, limping on his corns. 

""Now when this poor long-truant husband stepped inside the house 
A torrent of abusive words descended from his spouse, 
But through this matrimonial welcome Pious smelt a mouse 
Whereat he charged his faithful wife to doff her skirt and blouse. 

""'You wretch,' she cried, as she undressed, 'Perhaps you think I'm tainted! 
Well, look! Here stand I naked, pure as any woman sainted.' 
Alack-a-day he raised his eyes to see the lamb he's painted 
But when he saw that monstrous ram- -Sir Peter Pious fainted. 

""As he came to, that fearful view once more bemazed his eyes, 
No lamb, thought he, could thus assume a grown up ram's disguise. 
'Look here,' he said, 'my faithful wife, come tell, but without lies, 
How came my little Lamb of God to grow to such a size?' 

""Since women in such situations never lose their wits 
She said, 'My lord, this might ram your two years' stay befits 
For during all that time your lamb was grown by little bits; 
Had you not stayed so long you'd find him still beneath my teats.' 

""The moral lesson to this tale you'll find is clear as day— 
Don't be a Peter Pious for some understudy gay; 
Go entertain the girl you've got in love's peculiar way 
But watch out lest another man comes hankering for play. 

""Sir Peter Pious flushed the game, but after was unwilling 
To hold the chase; perhaps he thought the exercise too grilling. 
Another sportsman caught the scent and rode without a spilling 
Until he clipped his quarry's tail and made a pleasant killing. 

""The lady doubtless reasoned thus. 'This man I wed at first, 
Beside my second gallant is a very babe, ill-nursed; 
Since first is worst, then first be cursed, 
I'll take the better versed, 
And while I durst, I'll slake his thirst and live in love 
immersed.' 

""Now should you ever see a man conversing with a beauty, 
No matter if the girl is his or not, make it your duty 
To scrape acquaintance with him, don't adopt a manner snooty 
But do him favors for her sake-'twill help you win your booty. 

""A little money often helps to make a wondrous spree 
For ne'er was woman born who would not jiggle for a fee. 
If every man has got his price, each girl has two or three, 
So be it much or be it little, give with gesture free.” 

","I will tell you the story of what the woman forgets:
If you see that it's a joke, tell me another clever one.
It was Don Pitas Pajas, a painter from Brittany;
He married a young woman, a companion.

Before the completed month he said: “Nostra dona,
""I'm flying to Frandes, I'll carry a lot of money.""
She says: ""Monssner, you are in good time;
""Don't forget your house or mine.""

Dixol' don Pitas Payas: ""Doña de beauty,
""I fly into you a good figure.
""that you may be kept from all other folly.""
She said: ""Monssener, show your restraint.""

Pyntol' is the name of a little lamb.
Don Pytas Pajas goes to be a new merchant.
It took him two years there, much of it was late,
Façías' gives you a whole month of a year.

As the girl was remarried,
aví with her husband little date home;
He took an understander and populated the inn,
we destroy the lamb, we don't find anything from it.

When she heard that the painter was coming,
very quickly he sent for the understander;
He told him to paint it, as best he could,
in that same place a smaller lamb.

Pyntóle with the great rush a sheep sheep
full of head, with all his equipment;
Then on that day the messenger came:
that Don Pytas Pajas was already certain about this.


When Frandes' painter was already come,
It was from his wife with received disdain;
Since I've already been with her in the palace,
the sign that the feziera did not forget.

Don Pytas Pajas said: ""Madona, sy vos plaz""
""Show me the figure and enjoy it!""
The woman said: “Monseñer, you yourself:
""faithfully and ardently everything that flies.""

Don Pytas Pajas tasted the aforementioned place,
e vydo grand ram with weapons to lend.
""How, Madonna, is this or how could it be,
""I painted corder, did I get this delicacy?""

As on this date the woman is syenpre
sotil e malsabyda, he says: “How, Monsignor,
""in two years asked corder non se fer carner?
""Come here, trobaríades corder.""

Therefore it punishes you, it does not allow what you ask for:
Do not be Pytas Pamjas, for another do not err.
With beautiful sayings to the conbydes woman:
Since I promise you, don't forget it.

Pedro picks up the hare and moves it from the tail,
Don't follow her or take her, look like a hunter;
another Pedro who follows her and runs her more subtly,
Take it; this answers to caçadores mill.

Dyz' the woman muttered: ""This is another Pedro.
""More smart and more ardit, than the first one to love:
""the first bet of this one is worth nothing more than a celebration,
""I'll do this one for this one, may God help me!""

Also when you see who uses it with her,
Whether it is hers or not, talk to her for her love;
If you can, give something, don't complain:
ca these things can bring a woman to her.

For byen little thing of your aver,
that you dye, serve her loyally, do what you want,
He will do for the money everything you ask for:
How little or how much, give it every chance you can.

"Como dice Aristótiles, cosa es verdadera: 
el mundo por dos cosas trabaja: la primera, 
por aver manteneçia; la otra cosa era 
por aver juntamiento con fenbra plazentera. 

Sy lo dexies' de mío, sería de culpar; 
dízelo grand filósofo: non so yo de raptar; 
de lo que dize el sabio non devedes dudar, 
ca por obra se prueba el sabio e su fablar. 

Que diz' verdat el sabio claramente se prueba: 
omes, aves, animalias, toda bestia de cueva 
quiere, segunt natura, conpaña siempre nueva; 
e muncho más el ome, que toda cosa que s' mueva. 

Digo muy más el ome, que de toda criatura: 
todas a tienpo çierto se juntan con natura; 
el ome de mal sesso todo tienpo syn mesura, 
cadaque puede e quier' facer esta locura. 

El ffuego ssienpre quiere estar en las çeniza, 
comoquier que más arde, quanto más se atiza:

provar ome las cosas non es por ende peor,

His first and most important care concerns his own nutrition, 
His second, and the pleasantest, is afterward coition 
With any dame that proffers him the opportune position. 

If on my own authority about a point so mooted 
I made this bold assertion I would surely be disputed. 
But what a wise philosopher has said cannot be hooted, 
Above all, when his arguments can never be confuted. 

And that this venerable sage has spoken truth 'tis clear 
For men and birds and animals—all critters far and near- 
According to the laws of nature find their females dear;
Particularly man to whom the act brings extra cheer. 
The beasts have all a stated time wherein they join to breed, 

But man, superior to the brutes, can couple without need; 
Wherefore he consecrates this act and writes it in his creed, 
And then, to show his sanctity, he oft repeats the deed. 

An incandescent coal indeed is passion's fierce desire; 
The more you try to blow it out the hotter burns its fire. 
What boots it if the soul should see her body in the mire 
When nature makes of man a hog and urges him no higher? 

So I, because I am a man, the same as any sinner, 
Have got of woman all she had whenever I could win her. 
To learn and sample is no shame for this sincere beginner 
Since thus I choose the good from bad and make my errors slimmer. 
","As Aristotle says, one thing is true:
The world works for two things: the first,
due to maintenance; the other thing was
to see the union with fenbra plazentera.

If you dexies' of mine, it would be to blame;
Great philosopher says it: I am not one to kidnap;
You should not doubt what the wise man says,
ca by deed the wise man proves himself in his talk.

That the wise man says the truth is clearly proven:
omes, birds, animals, all cave beasts
he wants, naturally, always new company;
The ome is much more than anything that moves.

I say more about ome than about any creature:
all at a certain time come together naturally;
the ome of bad sense all the time without moderation,
Every person can and wants to do this madness.

The fire always wants to be in the ashes,
The more it burns, the more it stokes:
The ome, when he sins, sees well that he slips;
But it doesn't split, nature straightens it.

And I, because I am ome, like another, sinner,
Ove of women sometimes great love:
Trying things is not therefore worse,
and know evil well, and use the best",,Elisha K. Kane,med
"Quiero abreviarvos, señores, la mi predicación,

De las chicas, que bien diga, el amor me fiso rruego, 
que diga de sus noblesas e quiérolas dezir luego: 
direvos de dueñas chicas, que lo tenedes en juego. 
Son frías como la nieve e arden más que 'l fuego: 

son frías de füera; en el amor ardientes,

En casa cuerdas, donosas, sosegadas, bienfasyentes;

For a never-ending sermon is my utter destestation: 
I like short women,--suits at law without procrastination,- 
And am always most delighted with things of short duration. 

A babbler is a laughing-stock; he's a fool who's always grinning;
But little women love so much, one falls in love with sinning. 
There are women who are very tall, and yet not worth the winning, 
And in the change of short for long repentance finds beginning. 

To praise the little women Love besought me in my musing; 
To tell their noble qualities is quite beyond refusing: 
So I'll praise the little women, and you'll find the thing amusing; 
They are, I know, as cold as snow, whilst flames around diffusing. 

They're cold without, whilst warm within the flame of Love is raging; 
They're gay and pleasant in the street,-soft, cheerful, and engaging; 
They're thrifty and discreet at home,--the cares of life assuaging: 
All this and more;—try, and you'll find how true is my presaging. 

In a little precious stone what splendor meets the eyes! 
In a little lump of sugar how much of sweetness lies! 
So in a little woman love grows and multiplies: 
You recollect the proverb says,—A Word unto the wise. 

A pepper-corn is very small, but seasons every dinner 
More than all other condiments, although 'tis sprinkled thinner: 
Just so a little woman is, if Love will let you win her,- 
There's not a joy in all the world you will not find in her. 

And as within the little rose you find the richest dyes, 
And in a little grain of gold much price the value lies, 
As from a little balsam much odor doth arise, 
So in a little woman there's a taste of paradise. 

Even as the little ruby its secret worth betrays, 
Color, and price, and virtue, in the clearness of its rays,- 
Just so a little woman much excellence displays, 
Beauty, and grace, and love, and fidelity always. 

The skylark and the nightingale, though small and light of wing, 
Yet warble sweeter in the grove than all the birds that sing: 
And so a little woman, though a very little thing, 
Is sweeter far than sugar, and flowers that bloom in spring. 

The magpie and the golden thrush have many a thrilling note, 
Each as a gay musician doth strain his little throat, 
A merry little songster in his green and yellow coat: 
And such a little woman is, when Love doth make her dote. 

There's naught can be compared to her, throughout the wide creation; 
She is a paradise on earth,-our greatest consolation,- 
So cheerful, gay, and happy, so free from all vexation; 
In fine, she's better in the proof than in anticipation. 

If as her size increases are woman's charms decreased, 
Then surely it is good to be from all the great released. 
Now of two evils choose the less, --said a wise man of the East: 
By consequence, of woman-kind be sure to choose the least. 

","I want to abbreviate for you, gentlemen, my preaching,
I always paid myself a little sermon
of a small and brief owner:
ca the little and well said estate in the heart.

The one who laughs a lot is crazy, the one who laughs a lot is crazy,
The owner has a girl who loves big and small:
owners of big dy for girls, for big girls non exchange;
But the girls do not regret the trade because of the big ones.

Of the girls, let it be said well, love sees me, I pray,
Let him say about his nobles and want to say them later:
Direvos from girls owners, you have it at stake.
They are cold as snow and burn hotter than fire:

They are cold from the outside; in burning love,
in bed solace, work, pleasures and streams.
At home, sane, kind, calm, well-being;
Much to the failure of networks, ado byen walls lie.

In small girgonça there is great resplendor,
in sugar very little and there is a lot of sweetness:
In the little owner there is very great love:
few words satisfy the good understander.

The grain of good pepper is small;
but more than our conorta and warmer:
So little mistress, let all love consent,
It does not please the world that he does not sit in it.

As in a pink girl there is a lot of color,
and in gold very little great price and great value,
As in a little balm there is a great good smell:
ansy in owner girl yase very great love.

Like little Robby he has a lot of goodness,
color, vertuity and price, nobleness and clarity:
so little owner has a lot of beauty,
beauty and dignity, love and loyalty.

Girl is the calandria and boy is the royseñor;
but it sings sweeter than another greater bird:
The woman, because she is girl, is therefore not worse;
with doñeo it is sweeter than sugar or flower.

They are small parrot birds;
but any of them is a sweet screamer,
adored, beautiful, precious, singing:
well atal is the little owner with love.
In the little woman there is no comparison: earthly paradise is consolation, solitude and joy, pleasure and blessing,
It is better in the test than in the greeting!
Ssyempre quis' woman girl, more than grand' nin
elderly:
It's not a bad idea to be a foydor!
From evil, take the least: the wise man tells them:
After all, of women, the younger is the better!",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,med
"La fuerza del fuego que alumbra que ciega 
mi cuerpo, mi alma, mi muerte, mi vida, 
do entra, do hiere, do toca, do llega, 
mata y no muere su llama encendida. 
Pues ¿qué haré triste, que todo me ofende? 
Lo bueno y lo malo me causan congoja, 
quemándome el fuego que mata, que enciende, 
su fuerza que fuerza, que ata, que prende, 
que prende, que suelta, que tira, que afloja. 

A do iré triste, que alegre me halle, 
pues tantos peligros me tienen en medio, 
que llore, que ría, que grite, que calle, 
ni tengo, ni quiero, ni espero remedio. 
No quiero que quiere, ni quiero querer, 
pues tanto me quiere tan rabiosa plaga, 
ni ser yo vencido, ni quiero vencer, 
ni quiero pesar, ni quiero placer, 
ni sé que me diga, ni sé que me haga. ","Oh! fierce is this flame that seizes my breath,
My body, my soul, my life, and my death; 
It burns in its fury, it kindles desire, 
It consumes, but alas! it will never expire. 

How wretched my lot! No respite I know, 
My heart is indifferent to joy or to woe; 
For this flame in its anger kills, burns, and destroys, 
My grief and my pleasures, my sorrows and joys. 

In the midst of such perils, all methods I try, 
To escape from my fate—I weep, laugh, and sigh; 
I would hope, I would wish for some respite from grief, 
But have not a wish, to wish for relief. 

If I vanquish this foe, or if vanquished I be, 
Is alike in the midst of my torments to me; 
I would please, and displease, but between me and you, 
I know not, alas! what I say or I do. ","The force of fire that illuminates that blinds
my body, my soul, my death, my life,
when it enters, when it hurts, when it touches, when it arrives,
It kills and does not die its burning flame.
Well, what will I do sad, since everything offends me?
The good and the bad cause me anguish,
burning me the fire that kills, that lights,
its strength that forces, that binds, that catches,
that turns on, that releases, that pulls, that loosens.

Where will I go sad, how happy I will be,
because so many dangers have me in the middle,
let him cry, let him laugh, let him shout, let him be silent,
I neither have, nor want, nor do I expect a remedy.
I don't want to want, nor do I want to want,
because such a rabid plague loves me so much,
nor will I be defeated, nor do I want to win,
I neither want regret, nor do I want pleasure,
I don't know what he says to me, nor do I know what he does to me.",,Thomas Roscoe,fifteenth_cent
"Voluntad, no trabajéys 
por alcançar buena vida, 
que la mejor escogida 
que fue, ni será, ni es, 
cuydado es para después. 

Que acordaros del passado 
dulce tiempo que gastastes,

With anxious thought and busy care! 
Whatever be thy doom,-whate'er 
Thy power, or thy perverseness,—still 
A germ of sorrow will be there. 

If thou wilt think of moments gone, 
Of joys as exquisite as brief, 
Know, memory, when she lingers on 
Past pleasure, turns it all to grief. 
The struggling toil for bliss is vain, 
The dreams of hope are vainer yet, 
The end of glory is regret, 
And death is but the goal of pain, 
And memory's eye with tears is wet. ","Will, don't work
to achieve a good life,
that the best chosen
that was, nor will be, nor is,

What to remember about the past
sweet time you spent,
you already know that this care
It kills you more than you enjoyed;
therefore don't work

"Moça tan fermosa 
non vi en la frontera, 
como una vaquera 
de la Finojosa. 

Faziendo la vía 
del Calatreveño 
a Sancta María, 
vencido del sueño, 
por tierra fragosa 
perdí la carrera, 
do vi la vaquera 
de la Finojosa. 

En un verde prado 
de rosas e flores, 
guardando ganado 
con otros pastores, 
la vi tan graciosa 
que apenas creyera 
que fuesse vaquera 
de la Finojosa. 

Non creo las rosas 
de la primavera 
sean tan fermosas 
nin de tal manera 
(fablando sin glosa), 
si antes sopiera 
de aquella vaquera 
de la Finojosa. 

Non tanto mirara 
su mucha beldad 
porque me dexara 
en mi libertad. 
Mas dixe: ""Donosa"" 
(por saber quién era), 
""¿dónde es la vaquera 
de la Finojosa?"" 

Bien como rindo, 
dixo: ""Bien vengades; 
que ya bien entiendo 
lo que demandades: 
non es deseosa 
de amar, nin lo espera 
aquessa vaquera 
de la Finojosa."" ","Once making a journey 
To Santa María 
From Calataveño, 
From weary desire 
Of sleep, down a valley 
I strayed, where young Rosa 
I saw, the milk maiden 
Of lone Finojosa. 

In a pleasant green meadow, 
Midst roses and grasses, 
Her herd she was tending, 
With other fair lasses; 
So lovely her aspect, 
I could not suppose her 
A simple milk-maiden 
Of rude Finojosa. 

I think not primroses 
Have half her smile's sweetness. 
Or mild modest beauty; 
(I speak with discreetness) 
O had I before hand 
But know of this Rosa, 
The handsome milk-maiden 
Of far Finojosa. 

Her very great beauty 
Had not so subdued, 
Because it had left me 
To do as I would. 
I have said more, oh fair one! 
By learning 'twas Rosa, 
The charming milk-maiden 
Of sweet Finojosa. ","Moça so beautiful
I didn't see on the border,
like a cowgirl
of the Finojosa.

Paving the way
from Calatreveño
to Holy Mary,
defeated from sleep,
through rocky land
I lost the race
I saw the cowgirl
of the Finojosa.

In a green meadow
of roses and flowers,
guarding cattle
with other shepherds,
I saw her so funny
that I barely believed
that she was a cowgirl
of the Finojosa.

I don't believe the roses
of spring
they are so beautiful
nor in such a way
(speaking without gloss),
if I had dreamed before
of that cowgirl
of the Finojosa.

I won't look so much
her great beauty
because he would leave me
in my freedom.
But I said: ""Donosa""
(to know who he was),
""where is the cowgirl
of Finojosa?""

Well how I perform,
He said: ""Well come,
that I understand well
what you demand:
is not willing
to love, you don't even expect it
aquessa cowgirl
of the Finojosa.""",,Thomas Roscoe,fifteenth_cent
"Recuerde el alma dormida, 
abive el seso y despierte, 
contemplando 
cómo se passa la vida, 
cómo se viene la muerte 
tan callando; 
cuán presto se va el plazer, 
cómo después de acordado, 
da dolor, 
cómo, a nuestro parescer, 
cualquiera tiempo passado 
fue mejor. 

Pues si vemos lo presente 
cómo en un punto se es ido 
y acabado, 
si juzgamos sabiamente, 
daremos lo no venido 
por passado. 
No se engañe nadie, no, 
pensando que ha de durar 
lo que espera 
más que duró lo que vio, 
pues que todo ha de pasar 
por tal manera. 

Nuestras vidas son los ríos 
que van a dar en la mar, 
que es el morir: 
allí van los señoríos 
derechos a se acabar 
y consumir; 
allí los ríos caudales, 
allí los otros medianos 
ya más chicos, 
allegados son iguales, 
los que biven por sus manos
y los ricos.  

Dexo las invocaciones 
de los famosos poetas 
y oradores; 
no curo de sus ficciones, 
que traen yervas secretas 
sus sabores. 
Aquel solo me encomiendo, 
aquel solo invoco yo 
de verdad, 
que en este mundo biviendo, 
el mundo no conosció 
su diedad. 

Este mundo es el camino 
para el otro, que es morada 
sin pesar; 
mas cumple tener buen tino 
para andar esta jornada 
sin errar. 
Partimos cuando nascemos, 
andamos mientra bivimos, 
y llegamos 
al tiempo que fenescemos; 
assí que cuando morimos 
descansamos. 

Este mundo bueno fue 
si bien usássemos dél 
como devemos, 
porque, según nuestra fe, 
es para ganar aquel 
que atendemos. 
Y aun aquel fijo de Dios, 
para sobirnos al cielo, 
descendió 
a nascer acá entre nos, 
y a bivir en este suelo 
do murió. 

Ved de cuán poco valor 
son las cosas tras que andamos 
y corremos, 
que, en este mundo traidor, 
aun primero que muramos 
las perdemos: 
dellas desfaze la edad, 
dellas casos desastrados 
que acaescen, 
dellas, por su calidad, 
en los más altos estados 
desfallescen. 
Dezidme, la fermosura,
Ia gentil frescura y tez 
de la cara,
Ia color y la blancura,
cuando viene la vejez
,cual se para?
Las mafias y ligereza 
y la fuerça corporal
de joventud,
todo se torna graveza 
cuando llega el arraval 
de senectud.
Pues la sangre de los godos, 
y el linage y la nobleza
tan crescida,
por cuantas vias y modos 
se sume su grand alteza 
en esta vida!
Unos, por poco valer, 
por cuan baxos y abatidos 
que los tienen!
Y otros, por no tener, 
con oficios no devidos 
se mantienen.
Los estados y riqueza, 
que nos dexan a desora,
,quien lo duda?
No les pidamos firmeza 
pues que son de una senora 
que se muda;
que bienes son de Fortuna 
que rebuelve con su rueda 
presurosa,
la cual no puede ser una 
ni estar estable ni queda 
en una cosa.
Pero digo que acompañen 
y lleguen hasta la huessa 
con su dueflo:
por esso no nos engaflen, 
pues se va la vida apriessa 
como sueflo.
Y los deleites de aca
son, en que nos deleitamos, 
temporales,
y los tormentos de alla, 
que por ellos esperamos, 
eternales.
Los plazeres y dulçores 
desta vida trabajada
quetenemos,
que son sino corredores, 
y la muerte la celada
en que caemos?
No mirando nuestro dafio, 
corremos a rienda suelta
sin parar;
desque vemos el engafio 
y queremos dar la buelta, 
no hay lugar.
Si fuesse en nuestro poder 
tornar la cara fermosa 
corporal,
como podemos fazer 
el anirna gloriosa, 
angelical,
ique diligencia tan biva 
tovierarnos toda hora,
y tan presta,
en componer la cativa, 
dexandonos la senora 
descornpuesta!
Essos reyes poderosos 
que vernos por escrituras 
ya passadas,
con casos tristes, llorosos, 
fueron sus buenas venturas 
trastornadas:
assf que no hay cosa fuerte, 
que a papas y ernperadores
y prelados,
assf los trata la Muerte 
corno a los pobres pastores 
de ganados.
Dexemos a los troyanos, 
que sus males no los virnos, 
ni sus glorias;
dexemos a los rornanos, 
aunque oímos y leímos 
sus estorias,
no curernos de saber 
lo de aquel siglo passado 
que fue dello;
vengamos a lo de ayer, 
que tan bien es olvidado 
corno aquello.
Que se fizo el rey don Juan? 
Los infantes de Aragón,
,que se fizieron?
Que fue de tanto galán?
Que fue de tanta invención 
corno truxieron?
Las justas y los tomeos, 
pararnentos, bordaduras,
y cimeras,
,fueron sino devaneos?
,que fueron sino verduras 
de las eras?
Que se fizieron las damas 
sus tocados, sus vestidos,
sus olores?
Que se fizieron las llamas 
de los fuegos encendidos 
de amadores?
Que se fizo aquel trobar,
las musicas acordadas 
que tañían?
Que se fizo aquel dançar,
aquellas ropas chapadas 
que traían?
Pues el otro su heredero, 
don Enrique, que poderes 
alcançava!
Cuan blando, cuan falaguero 
el mundo con sus plazeres
se le dava!
Mas vereis cuan enemigo, 
cuan contrario, cuan cruel 
se le mostró,
aviendole sido amigo, 
cuan poco duró con el 
lo que le dio.
Las dadivas desmedidas, 
los edificios reales
llenos de oro,
las vaxillas tan febridas, 
los enriques y reales 
del tesoro,
los jaezes, los cavallos 
de su gente, y atavios 
tan sobrados,
dónde iremos a buscallos?
,que fueron sino rocíos 
de los prados?

que en su vida sucessor
se llamó,
que corte tan excelente 
tuvo, y cuanto grand senor 
le siguió!
Mas, como fuesse mortal 
metióle la Muerte luego 
en su fragua.
O, juizio divinal!:
cuando mas ardia el fuego, 
echaste agua.
Pues aquel grand condestable, 
maestre que conoscimos
tan privado,
no cumple que del se fable,
sino solo que lo vimos 
degollado.
Sus infinitos tesoros 
sus villas y sus lugares, 
su mandar,
que le fueron sino lloros? 
que fueron sino pesares 
al dexar?
Pues los otros dos hermanos, 
maestres tan prosperados 
como reyes,
que a los grandes y medianos 
truxieron tan sojuzgados
a sus leyes;
aquella prosperidad 
que tan alta fue sobida 
y ensalçada,
que fue sino claridad
que estando mas encendida
fue amatada?
Tantos duques excelentes, 
tantos marqueses y condes 
y varones
como vimos tan potentes, 
di, Muerte, dó los escondes
y traspones?
Y las sus claras hazañas 
que fizieron en las guerras 
y en las pazes,
cuando tu, cruda, te ensañas, 
con tu fuerça las atierras
y desfazes.
Las huestes innumerables, 
los pendones y estandartes 
y vanderas,
los castillos impunables, 
los muros y baluartes
y barreras,
la cava honda, chapada, 
o cualquier otro reparo, 
que aprovecha?
que si tu vienes airada, 
todo lo passas de claro 
con tu flecha.
iOh, mundol Pues que nos matas, 
fuera la vida que diste
toda vida;
mas segun aca nos tratas, 
lo mejor y menos triste 
es la partida
de tu vida, tan cubierta
de tristezas y dolores, 
despoblada;
de los bienes tan desierta, 
de placeres y dulzores 
despojada.
Es tu comienzo lloroso, 
tu salida siempre amarga 
y nunca buena,
lo de enmedio trabajoso,
y a quien das vida mas larga 
das mas pena.
Asi los bienes-muriendo
y con sudor-se procuran 
y los das;
los males vienen corriendo;
despues de venidos, duran 
mucho mas.

No dexó grandes tesoros, 
ni alcançó muchas riquezas 
ni vaxillas,
mas fizo guerra a los moros, 
ganando sus fortelezas
y sus villas;
y en las lides que venció, 
muchos moros y cavallos 
se perdieron;
y en este oficio ganó
las rentas y los vassallos 
que le dieron.
Pues por su onra y estado, 
en otros tiempos passados 
Cómo se huvo?
Quedando desamparado,
con hermanos y criados
se sostuvo.
Despues que fechos famosos 
fizo en esta dicha guerra
que fazia,
fizo tratos tan onrosos
que le dieron aun mas tierra 
que tenia.
Estas sus viejas estorias 
que con su braço pinto
en joventud,
con otras nuevas victorias 
agora las renovó
en senectud.
Por su grand abilidad, 
por meritos y anciania 
bien gastada,
alcançó la dignidad 
de la grand cavalleria 
del Espada.
Y sus villas y sus tierras 
ocupades de tiranos
las falló,
mas por cercos y por guerras 
y por fuerça de sus manos 
las cobró.
Pues nuestro rey natural, 
si de las obras que obró 
fue servido,
sigalo el de Portugal
y en Castilla quien siguió 
su partido.
Despues de puesta la vida 
tantas vezes por su ley
al tablero
despues de tan bien servida 
la corona de su rey 
verdadero,
despues de tanta hazana
a que non puede bastar 
cuenta cierta,
en su villa de Ocana 
vino la Muerte a llamar 
a su puerta,
diziendo: ""Buen cavallero, 
dexad el mundo engañoso
y su halago;
vuestro coraçón de azero 
muestre su esfuerço famoso 
en este trago;
y pues de vida y salud 
fezistes tan poca cuenta
 por la fama,
esfuercese la virtud 
para sofrir esta afruenta 
que vos llama.
""No se os faga tan amarga 
la batalla temerosa
que esperais,
pues otra vida mas larga 
de la fama glorïosa
aca dexais.
Aunque esta vida de onor 
tampoco no es eternal
ni verdadera,
mas, con todo, es muy mejor 
que la otra temporal, 
perescedera.
""El bivir que es perdurable 
no se gana con estados 
mundanales,
ni con vida deleitable
en que moran los pecados 
infemales;
mas los buenos religiosos 
gananlo con oraciones
y con lloros;
los cavalleros famosos, 
con trabajos y aflicciones 
contra moros.
""Y pues vos, claro varón, 
tanta sangre derramastes 
de paganos,
esperad el galardón
que en este mundo ganastes 
por las manos;
y con esta confiança, 
y con la fe tan entera 
que teneis,
partid con buena esperarnça 
que estotra vida tercera 
ganareis

en esta vida mezquina
por tal modo,
que mi voluntad esta 
conforme con la divina 
para todo;
y consiento en mi morir 
con voluntad plazentera, 
clara y pura,
que querer ombre bivir
cuando Dios quiere que muera, 
es locura.
""Tu, que por nuestra maldad, 
tomaste forma servil
y baxo nombre,

juntaste cosa tan vil 
como el ombre;
Tu, que tan grandes tormentos 
sofriste sin resistencia
en tu persona,
no por mis merescimientos,
 mas por tu sola clemencia 
me perdona.""
Assi con ta! entender, 
todos sentidos umanos 
conservados,
cercado de su muger, 
de sus fijos y hermanos 
y criados,
dio el alma a quien gela dio, 
el cual la ponga en el cielo
en su gloria.
y aunque la vida murió, 
nos dexó harto consuelo 
su memoria.
","O, let the soul her slumbers break! 
Let thought be quickened and awake,-- 
Awake to see 
How soon this life is past and gone
And death comes softly stealing on, 
How silently! 

Swiftly our pleasures glide away: 
Our hearts recall the distant day 
With many sighs; 
The moments that are speeding fast 
We heed not; but the past—the past— 
More highly prize. 

Onward its course the present keeps, 
Onward the constant current sweeps, 
Till life is done; 
And did we judge of time aright, 
The past and future of their flight 
Would be as one. 

Let no one fondly dream again 
That Hope and all her shadowy train 
Will not decay 
Fleeting as were the dreams of old, 
Remembered like a tale that's told, 
They pass away. 

Our lives are rivers gliding free 
To that unfathomed, boundless sea, 
The silent grave: 
Thither all earthly pomp and boast 
Roll to be swallowed up and lost 
In one dark wave. 
Thither the mighty torrents stray, 
Thither the brook pursues its way
And tinkling rill. 
There all are equal. Side by side, 
The poor man and the son of pride 
Lie calm and still. 

I will not here invoke the throng 
Of orators and sons of song, 
The deathless few; 
Fiction entices and deceives, 
And sprinkling o'er her fragrant leaves 
Lies poisonous dew. 

To One alone my thoughts arise,— 
The Eternal Truth,-the Good and Wise: 
To Him I cry, 
Who shared on earth our common lot, 
But the world comprehended not 
His deity. 

This world is but the rugged road 
Which leads us to the bright abode 
Of peace above; 
So let us choose the narrow way 
Which leads no traveller's foot astray 
From realms of love. 

Our cradle is the starting place; 
In life we run the onward race, 
And reach the goal; 
When, in the mansions of the blest, 
Death leaves to its eternal rest 
The weary soul. 

Did we but use it as we ought, 
This world would school each wandering thought 
To its high state. 
Faith wings the soul beyond the sky, 
Up to the better world on high 
For which we wait. 

Yes, -the glad messenger of love, 
To guide us to our home above, 
The Saviour; 
Born amid moral cares and fears, 
He suffered in this vale of tears 
A death of shame. 

Behold of what delusive worth 
The bubbles we pursue on earth, 
The shapes we chase, 
Amid a world of treachery! 
They vanish ere death shuts the eye, 
And leave no trace. 

Time steals them from us,-chances strange, 
Disastrous accidents, and change, 
That come to all: 
Even in the most exalted state, 
Relentless sweeps the stroke of fate; 
The strongest fall. 

Tell me, --the charms that lovers seek 
In the clear eye and blushing cheek,- 
The hues that play 
O'er rosy lip and brow of snow, 
When hoary age approaches slow, 
Ah, where are they? 

The noble blood of Gothic name. 
Heroes emblazoned high to fame 
In long array, 
How, in the onward course of time, 
The landmarks of that race sublime 
Were swept away! 

Some, the degraded slaves of lust, 
Prostrate and trampled in the dust, 
Shall rise no more; 
Others by guilt and crime maintain 
the scutcheon that without a stain 
Their fathers bore. 

Wealth and the high estate of pride, 
With what untimely speed they glide, 
How soon depart! 
Bid not the shadowy phantoms stay,- 
The vassals of a mistress they, 
Of fickle heart. 

These gifts in Fortune's hands are found; 
Her swift-revolving wheel turns round, 
And they are gone! 
No rest the inconstant goddess knows, 
But changing, and without respose, 
Still hurries on. 

Even could the hand of avarice save 
Its gilded baubles, till the grave 
Reclaimed its prey, 
Let none on such poor hopes rely; 
Life, like an empty dream flits by, 
And where are they? 

Earthly desires and sensual lust 
Are passions springing from the dust,- 
They fade and die; 
But, in the life beyond the tomb, 
They seal the immortal spirit's doom 
Eternally! 
The pleasure and delights which mask In treacherous smiles life's serious task, 
What are they all, 
But the fleet coursers of the chase,- 
And death an ambush in the race, 
Wherein we fall? 

No foe, no dangerous pass we heed, 
Brook no delay,-but onward speed,
With loosened rein;
And when the fatal snare is near, 
We strive to check our mad career, 
But strive in vain.

Could we new charms to age impart. 
And fashion with a cunning art
The human face,
As we can clothe the soul with light, 
And make the glorious spirit bright
With heavenly grace,-

How busily, each passing hour, 
Should we exert that magic power!
What ardor show
To deck the sensual slave of sin, 
Yet leave the freeborn soul within
In weeds of woe!

Monarchs, the powerful and the strong, 
Famous in history and in song
Of olden time,
Saw, by the stem decrees of fate, 
Their kingdom lost, and desolate
Their race sublime.

Who is the champion? Who the strong? 
Pontiff and priest, and sceptered throng?
On these shall fall
As heavily the hand of Death,
As when it stays the shepherd's breath 
Beside his stall.

l speak not of the Trojan name,­ 
Neither its glory nor its shame
Has met our eyes;
Nor of Rome's great and glorious dead,­ 
Though we have heard so oft, and read,
Their histories.

Little avails it now to know 
Of ages past so long ago,
Nor how they rolled; 
Our theme shall be of yesterday 
Which to oblivion sweeps away,
Like days of old.

Where is the king Don Juan? Where 
Each royal prince and noble heir
Of Aragon?
Where are the courtly gallantries? 
The deeds of love and high emprise,
In battle done?

Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye, 
And scarf, and gorgeous panoply,
And nodding plume
What were they but a pageant scene? 
What but the garlands, gay and green 
That deck the tomb?
Where are the high-born dames, and where 
Their gay attire and jewelled hair,
And odors sweet?
Where are the gentle knights, that came 
To kneel, and breathe love's ardent flame,
Low at their feet?
Where is the song of Troubadour? 
Where are the lute and gay tambour
They loved of yore?
Where is the mazy dance of old,-
The flowing robes, inwrought with gold, 
The dancers wore?
And he who next the sceptre swayed, 
Henry, whose royal court displayed
Such power and pride,- 
O, in what winning smiles arrayed, 
The world its various pleasures laid
His throne beside!
But, O, how false and full of guile 
That world, which wore so soft a smile
But to betray!
She, that had been his friend before, 
Now from the fated monarch tore
Her charms away.
The countless gifts,-the stately walls, 
The royal palaces, and halls,
All filled with gold;
Plate with armorial bearings wrought, 
Chambers with ample treasures fraught
Of wealth untold;
The noble steeds, and harness bright, 
The gallant lord, and stalwart knight,
In rich array;-
Where shall we seek them now? Alas! 
Like the bright dew-drops on the grass,
They passed away.
His brother, too, whose factious zeal 
Usurped the sceptre of Castile,
Unskilled to reign,- 
What a gay, brilliant court had he, 
When all the flower of chivalry
Was in his train!
But he was mortal, and the breath
That flamed from the hot forge of Death 
Blasted his years;
Judgment of God! that flame by thee 
When raging fierce and fearfully,        '
Was quenched in tears!
Spain's haughty Constable,-the true
And gallant Master,-whom we knew 
Most loved of all,-
Breathe not a whisper of his pride; 
He on the gloomy scaffold died,­
Ignoble fall!
The countless treasures of his care,
 His hamlets green and cities fair,
His mighty power,-
What were they all but grief and shame, 
Tears and a broken heart, when came
The parting hour?
His other brothers, proud and high,­ 
Masters, who, in prosperity,
Might rival kings,-
Who made the bravest and the best 
The bondsmen of their high behest, 
Their underlings,-
What was their prosperous estate, 
When high and exalted and elate
With power and pride?
What, but a transient gleam of light,­ 
A flame, which, glaring at its height,
Grew dim and died?
So many a duke of royal name, 
Marquis and count of spotless fame,
And baron brave,
That might the sword of empire wield,­ 
All these, O Death, hast thou concealed
In the dark grave!
Their deeds of mercy and of arms, 
In peaceful days, or war's alarms,
When thou dost show,
O Death, thy stern and angry face,
One stroke of thy all-powerful mace
Can overthrow!
Unnumbered hosts, that threaten nigh,­ 
Pennon and standard flaunting high,
And flat displayed,-
High battlements intrenched around, 
Bastion, and moated wall, and mound,
And palisade,
And covered trench, secure and deep,­ 
All these cannot one victim keep,
O Death, from thee,
When thou dost battle in thy wrath, 
And thy strong shafts pursue their path
Unerringly!
O world! so few the years we live,
Would that the life which thou dost give 
Were life indeed!
Alas! thy sorrow fall so fast,
Our happiest hour is when, at last, 
The soul is freed.
Our days are covered o'er with grief, 
And sorrows neither few nor brief
Veil all in gloom;

Left desolate of real good, 
Within this cheerless solitude
No pleasures bloom.
Thy pilgrimage begins in tears,
And ends in bitter doubts and fears, 
Or dark despair;
Midway so many toils appear, 
That he who lingers longest here
Knows most of care.
Thy goods are bought with many a groan, 
by the hot sweat of toil alone,
And weary hearts;
Fleet-footed is the approach of woe, 
But with a lingering step and slow
Its form departs.
And he, the good man's shield and shade, 
To whom all hearts their homage paid,
As Virtue's son,-
Rodrick Manrique,-he whose name 
Is written on the scroll of Fame,
Spain's champion;
His signal deeds and prowess high 
Demand no pompous eulogy,-
Ye saw his deeds!
Why should their praise in verse be sung? 
The name that dwells on every tongue
No minstrel needs.
To friends a friend;-how kind to all 
The vassals of this ancient hall
And feudal fief!
To foes how stern a foe was he! 
And to the valiant and the free
How brave a chief!
What prudence with the old and wise! 
What grace in youthful gayeties!
In all how sage!
Benignant to the serf and slave,
He showed the base and falsely brave 
A lion's rage.
His was the Octavian's prosperous star, 
The rush of Caesar's conquering car
At battle's call;
His, Scipio's virtue; his, the skill 
And the indomitable will
Of Hannibal.
His was a Trojan's goodness; his 
A Titus' noble charities
And righteous laws;
The arm of Hector, and the might 
Of Tully, to maintain the right
In truth's just cause; 
The clemency of Antonine; 
Aurelius' countenance divine
Firm, gentle, still;
 
The eloquence of Adrian;
And Theodosius' love to man, 
And generous will;
In tented field and bloody fray, 
An Alexander's virgorous sway
And stem command;
The faith of Constantine; ay, more,­ 
The fervent love Camillus bore
His native land.
He left no well filled treasury,
He heaped no pile of riches high, 
Nor massive plate;
He fought the Moors,-and, in their fall, 
City and tower and castled wall
Were his estate.
Upon the hard-fought battle-ground 
Brave steeds and gallant riders found
A common grave;
And there the warrior's hand did gain 
The rents, and the long vassal train,
That conquest gave.
And if, of old, his halls displayed 
The honored and exalted grade
His worth had gained, 
So, in the dark, disastrous hour,
Brothers and bondsmen of his power 
His hand sustained.
After high deeds, not left untold,
In the stem warfare which of old 
'Twas his to share,
Such noble leagues he made, that more 
And fairer regions than before
His guerdon were.
These are the records, half-effaced, 
Which with the hand of youth, he traced
On history's page;
But with fresh victories he drew 
Each fading character anew
In his old age.
By his unrivalled skill, by great 
And veteran service to the state,
By worth adored,
He stood, in his high dignity,
The proudest knight of chivalry,- 
Knight of the Sword.
He found his cities and domains 
Beneath a tyrant's galling chains
And cruel power;
But, by fierce battle and blockade 
Soon his own banner was displayed
From every tower.
By the tried valor of his hand
His monarch and his native land 
Were nobly served;-
Let Portugal repeat the story,
And proud Castile, who shared the glory 
His arms deserved.
And when so oft, for weal or woe, 
His life upon the fatal throw
Had been cast down,­ 
When he had served, with patriot zeal 
Beneath the banner of Castile,
His sovereign's crown,-
And done such deeds of valor strong, 
That neither history nor song
Can count them all; 
Then, on Ocana's castled rock, 
Death at his portal came to knock,
With sudden call,-
Saying, ""Good Cavalier, prepare 
To leave this world of toil and care
With joyful mien;
Let thy strong heart of steel this day 
Put on its armour for the fray,-
The closing scene.
""Since thou hast been, in battle-strife, 
So prodigal of health and life,
For earthly fame,
Let virtue nerve thy heart again; 
Loud on the last stem battle-plain
They call thy name.
""Think not the struggle that draws near 
Too terrible for man, nor fear
To meet the foe;
Nor let thy noble spirit grieve, 
Its life of glorious fame to leave
On earth below.
""A life of honor and of worth 
Has no eternity on earth,­
'Tis but a name; 
And yet its glory far exceeds
That base and sensual life which leads 
To want and shame.
""The eternal life, beyond the sky, 
Wealth cannot purchase, nor the high
And proud estate;
The soul in dalliance laid,-the spirit 
Corrupt with sin,-shall not inherit
A joy so great.
""But the good monk, in cloistered cell, 
Shall gain it by his book and bell,
His prayers and tears;
And the brave knight, whose arm endures 
Fierce battle, and against the Moors
His standard rears.
""And thou, brave knight, whose hand has poured 
The life-blood of the pagan horde
O'er all the land,
In heaven shalt thou receive, at length, 
The guerdon of thy earthly strength
And dauntless hand.
""Cheered onward by this promise sure, 
Strong in the faith entire and pure
Thou dost profess, 
Depart,-thy hope is certainty;- 
The third-the better life on high
Thou shalt possess.""
""O Death, no more, no more delay! 
My spirit longs to flee away
And be at rest,-
The will of Heaven my will shall be,- 
I bow to the divine decree,
To God's behest.
""My soul is ready to depart,-
No thought rebels,-the obedient heart 
Breathes forth no sigh;
The wish on earth to linger still
Were vain, when 'tis God's sovereign will 
That we shall die.
""O thou, that for our sins didst take 
A human form, and humbly make
Thy home on earth!
Thou, that to thy divinity 
A human nature didst ally
By mortal birth,-
,,And in that form didst suffer here 
Torment, and agony, and fear,
So patiently!
By thy redeeming grace alone, 
And not for merits of my own,
O, pardon me!""
As thus the dying warrior prayed, 
Without one gathering mist or shade
Upon his mind,- 
Encircled by his family,
Watched by affection's gentle eye, 
So soft and kind,-
His soul to Him who gave it rose; 
God lead it to its long respose,
Its glorious rest!
And, though the warrior's sun has set, 
Its light shall linger round us yet,
Bright, radiant, blest.
","Remember the sleeping soul,
clear your brain and wake up,
watching
how life goes,
how death comes
so silent;
how quickly the pleasure goes,
how after agreed,
gives pain,
how, in our opinion,
any past tense
It was better.

Well if we see what is present
how at one point it is gone
and finished,
If we judge wisely,
we will give what has not come
by pass.
Let no one be fooled, no,
thinking it has to last
what you expect
longer than what he saw lasted,
well everything has to happen
in such a way.

Our lives are rivers
that are going to hit the sea,
What is dying?
there go the lordships
rights to end
and consume;
there the flowing rivers,
there the other medium ones
more boys,
close friends are equal,
those who live by their hands
and the rich.

I leave the invocations
of famous poets
and speakers;
I don't cure his fictions,
that bring secret herbs
its flavors.
He only entrusted me,
I only invoke that one
really,
that in this living world,
the world did not know
his death.

This world is the way
for the other, which is purple
without regret;
it is better to have good sense
to walk this day
without error.
We leave when we are born,
we walk while we live,
and we arrived
at the time we end;
so when we die
we rested.

This good world was
although we used it
as we should,
because, according to our faith,
is to win that one
that we serve.
And even that fixed one of God,
to take us to heaven,
descended
to be born here among us,
and to live on this soil
do died.

See how little value
are the things we walk after
and we run,
that, in this treacherous world,
even before we die
we lose them:
some of them fade their age,
some disastrous cases
that happen,
of them, due to their quality,
in the highest states
they faint.
Dezidme, the beauty,
the gentle freshness and complexion
Of the face,
color and whiteness,
when old age comes
Which one stops?
The mafias and lightness
and body strength
of youth,
everything turns to gravity
when the arraval arrives
of senescence.
Well, the blood of the Goths,
and the lineage and the nobility
so grown up,
by how many ways and ways
his great highness joins
in this life!
Some, for little worth,
for how low and dejected
they have them!
And others, for not having,
with undue jobs
remain.
States and wealth,
that they leave us to desora,
Who doubts it?
Let's not ask them for firmness
Well, they belong to a lady.

What assets are from Fortune?
that turns with its wheel
hurried,
which cannot be a

But I say that they accompany
and reach the bone
with his owner:
so don't fool us,
because life goes quickly
how I dream
And the delights here
are, in which we delight,
temporary,
and the torments there,
that we hope for them,
eternal.
The pleasures and sweetness
from this worked life
what we have,
who are but runners,
and death the helmet
What do we fall into?
Not looking at our damage,
we run wild
non-stop;
since we see the deception
and we want to turn around,
there is no place.
If it were in our power

bodily,
how can we do
the glorious anirna,
angelic,
what a diligent effort
take us all the time,
and so ready,
in composing the cativa,

Those powerful kings
to see us for scriptures

with sad, tearful cases,
were his good fortunes
upset:
assf there is no strong thing,
that to popes and emperors
and prelates,
assf Death treats them
like the poor shepherds
of cattle.
Let's leave the Trojans,
that their evils will not be seen by us,
nor its glories;
let's leave the Rornanos,
although we heard and read
their stories,
not cure us of knowing
that of that last century
what was it;
Let's go back to yesterday,
how well it is forgotten
like that.
What did King Don Juan do?
The infantrymen of Aragon,
What happened?
What happened to all the handsome men?
What was so inventive?
how did they trux?
The jousting and the tomeos,
paraments, embroidery,
and crests,
Were they just dalliances?
What were but vegetables
of the ages?
What did the ladies do?
their headdresses, their dresses,
their smells?
that the flames broke out
of the lit fires
of lovers?
That trobar was made,
the agreed music
what did they play?
That dance was made,
those plated clothes
What did they bring?
Well, the other his heir,
Don Enrique, what powers
reach!
How soft, how falguero
the world with its pleasures
he gave it to him!
But you will see how enemy
how contrary, how cruel
was shown to him,
having been a friend,
how short it lasted with him
what he gave him.
The excessive gifts,
the royal buildings
full of gold,
the dishes so feverish,
the henries and royals
of the treasure,
the jaezes, the horses
of its people, and attire
so surplus,
where will we go to look for them?
which were but dews
of the meadows?
Well, his brother the innocent
that in his successor life
was called,
what an excellent cut
he had, and what a great lord
he followed!
But as if it were mortal
Death later put him
in his forge.
Oh, divine judgment!:
when the fire burned the most,
you poured water
Well, that great constable,
master we knew
so private,
It does not fulfill what is talkable,
but only that we saw it
beheaded
Its infinite treasures
its villas and its places,
his command,
What were they but tears?
that were but regrets
when leaving?
Well, the other two brothers,
masters so prosperous
like kings,
that the large and medium
they truxed so subjugated
to its laws;
that prosperity
How high was the drink?
and exalted,
what was but clarity
that being more turned on
Was she killed?
So many excellent dukes,
so many marquises and counts
and men
as we saw so powerful,
say, Death, give them away
and transposes?
And his clear exploits
who fought in wars
and in peace,
when you, raw, show yourself,
with your strength you land them
and mismatches.
The innumerable hosts,
the banners and banners
and vanderas,
the impunable castles,
the walls and bastions
and barriers,
the deep, plated cellar,
or any other repair,
What does it take advantage of?
that if you come angry,
everything is clear
with your arrow.
Oh, world, well, you kill us,
was the life you gave
all life;
but according to how you treat us here,
the best and least sad
it's the game
of your life, so covered
of sadness and pain,
depopulated;
of goods so deserted,
of pleasures and sweetness
stripped.
It's your tearful beginning,
your exit always bitter
and never good,
the middle is laborious,
and to whom you give longer life
you feel more sorry.
So the goods-dying
and with sweat-they seek
and you give them;
evils come running;
after they come, they last
much more.
The one with good shelter,
loved by virtuous
from the people,
Master Don Rodrigo
Manrique, so famous
and so brave;
its great and clear facts
It is not enough for me to praise them,
Well they saw them,
I don't even want to make them expensive,
because the world knows everything
Which were.
What a friend of his friends!
What a gentleman for servants
and relatives!
What an enemy of enemies!
What a teacher of hard workers
and brave!
What brains for discreet people!
What a grace for the gifted!
What reason!
How benign to the subjects!
and to the brave and harmful,
a lion!
In luck Octavtano,
Julius Caesar to win
and battle
in virtue, African,
Hannibal in knowledge
and work;
in goodness, a Trajan,
Tito in liberality
gladly;
in his arm, Aureliano,
Marcus Atilius in the truth
that promised.
Antonio Pio in mercy,
Marcus Aurelius in equality
of the countenance;
Adriano in eloquence,
Theodosius in humility
and good nature.
Aurelio Alexandre was,
in discipline and rigor
from the war;
a Constantine in the faith,
Camilo in great love
of his land.
He left no great treasures,
nor did he achieve much wealth
nor crockery,
but he waged war on the Moors,
gaining your strengths
and its towns;
and in the battles he won,
many Moors and horses
They got lost;
and in this profession he won
rents and vassals
that they gave him.
Well, for his honor and status,
in other times past
How did he escape?
Being left helpless,
with brothers and servants
was sustained.
After famous events
fought in this said war
what a fazia,
made such onerous deals
that they gave him even more land
that I had
These are your old stories
that with his arm he paints
in youth,
with other new victories
now he renewed them
in old age.
Due to its great ability,
for merit and seniority
well spent,
achieved dignity
of the grand cavalleria
of the Sword.
And its villas and its lands
occupation of tyrants
he failed them,
but because of sieges and wars
and by the strength of his hands
he collected them.
Well, our natural king,
yes of the works he did
was served,
follow him from Portugal
and in Castile who followed
his party.
After the end of life
so many times by your law
to the board
after so well served
your king's crown
TRUE,
after so much feat
because it can't be enough
true account,
in his villa in Ocana
Death came to call
at your door,
saying: ""Good knight,
leave the deceitful world
and his flattery;
your heart of steel
show your famous effort
in this drink;
and then of life and health
you thought so little
 for fame,
strive for virtue
to suffer this affort
that you call
""Don't make it so bitter
the fearful battle
what are you waiting for,
Well another longer life
of glorious fame
here you leave.
Although this life of honor
It is not eternal either
nor true,
but, nevertheless, it is much better
than the other temporary,
perishable
""The bivir that is enduring
you don't win with states
worldly,
nor with a delightful life
where sins dwell
infemales;
but the good religious
win it with prayers
and with tears
the famous knights,
with labors and afflictions
against Moors.
""And then you, of course man,
you spilled so much blood
of pagans,
wait for the award
that in this world you won
by the hands;
and with this confidence,
and with faith so complete
What do you have,
leave with good hope
that this another third life
you will win
-""Let's not waste time now
in this petty life
in this way,
that my will is
according to the divine
for all;
and I consent to my dying
with a pleasant will,
clear and pure,
what to want ombre bivir
When God wants me to die,
It's madness.
""You, who because of our wickedness,
you took a servile form
and under name,
You, that to your divinity
you put together something so vile
like the ombre;
You, what great torments
you suffered without resistance
in your person,
not because of my merits,
 but for your mercy alone
forgive me.""
So with ta! understand,
all human senses
preserved,
surrounded by his wife,
of his regulars and brothers
and servants,
He gave his soul to whom he gave,
who puts her in heaven
in his glory.
and although life died,
He left us a lot of comfort
his memory.
",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,fifteenth_cent
"Las huestes de don Ridrigo desmayaban y huian 
cuando en la octava batalla sus enemigos vendan. 
Rodrigo deja sus tiendas y del real se salia:
solo va el desventurado, sin ninguna compañia. 
El caballo de cansado ya mudar no se podía: 
camina por donde quiere, que no le estorba la vía. 
El rey va tan desmayado, que sentido no tenía;
muerto de sed y hambre, que de velle era gran mancilla; 
iba tan tinto de sangre, que una brasa parecía.
Las armas lleva abolladas, que eran de gran pedreria; 
la espada lleva hecha sierra de los golpes que tenia;
el almete de abollado en la cabeza se le hundía;
la cara lleva hinchada del trabajo que sufria.
Subióse encima de un cerro el mas alto que veía; 
desde allf mira su gente cómo iba de vencida.
De allí mira sus banderas, y estandartes que tenía, 
cómo estan i:odos pisados que la tierra los cubría; 
mira por los capitanes que ninguno parescía;
mira el campo tinto en sangre, la cual arroyos corria. 
El triste de ver aquesto gran mancilla en si tenia; 
llorando de los sus ojos de esta manera decía:
-Ayer erarey de Espana, hoy no lo soy de una villa; 
ayer villas y castillos, hoy ninguno poseia;
ayer tenfa criados, hoy ninguno me servía,
hoy no tengo ni una almena que pueda decir que es mia. 
Desdichada fue la hora, desidchado fue equel día
en que naci y herede  la tan grande señoría, 
pues lo habfa de perder todo junto y en un día!
Oh muerte! por que no vienes y llevas esta alma mia 
de aqueste cuerpo mezquino, pues se te agradeceria?
","Alone upon the battle ground, beneath a dying star,
Rodngo gazed in bleak despair, his hosts were scattered far;
Eight battles had they bravely fought against the Moorish band,
No hope remained within their hearts to save their native land.
Rodrigo sadly turned away, forespent with grief and pain,
And journeyed in the trackless night across the barren plain.
The king descended from his steed, for now 'twas lame and blind,
Alone he staggered faint and sick, no shelter could he find.
His sword was stained with blood and dust, as though from darkest hell
It had been plucked, its scarlet hue a tale of gore did tell;
His coat of mail, that set with jewels, had glistened in the sun
Now seemed to him a mourning cloth that some dark fate had spun.
At dawn he climbed a hill that towered above that harsh terrain,
Beneath him lay his banners torn, his noble soldiers slain.
And as the king in sorrow stared upon the cheerless morn,
He heard a cry of victory: the Arab shout of scorn!
He searched for the brave captains that led the hosts of Spain,
But he beheld their lifeless forms upon the gory plain. 
Rodrigo could no longer bear the burden of his woe,
These words he spoke as from his eyes the bitter tears did flow:
""Last night I was the king of Spain, today no fief command.
Last night fair castles held my train, today bereft I stand, 
The sun shall set forever on my kingdom and my reign,
The dawn will find no trace of me throughout this vast domain.
Oh hapless day when first I bore my scepter and my sword!
Accursed hour that I was named Hispania's ruling Lord!
Oh fate most cruel that I should see the sun go down this night!
Oh death, thou art victorious! Why fearest now to smite?""
","Don Ridrigo's hosts fainted and fled
when in the eighth battle his enemies sell.
Rodrigo leaves his stores and leaves the real estate:
Only the unfortunate one goes, without any company.
The horse was tired and could not move:
He walks where he wants, so that the path is not in his way.
The king is so fainted that it made no sense;
died of thirst and hunger, which once was a great stain;
It was so red with blood that it looked like an ember.
The weapons have dents, which were made of large stones;
The sword is sawn from the blows it received;
the dented almete on his head was sinking;
His face is swollen from the work he suffered.
He climbed on top of a hill, the highest he saw;
From there his people look how defeated they were.
From there he looks at his flags, and banners that he had,
how they are all stepped on that the earth covered them;
Look at the captains that none of them seemed;
Look at the field red in blood, which ran in streams.
He was sad to see what a great stain he had on himself;
crying from his eyes in this way he said:
-Yesterday I was king of Spain, today I am not king of a town;
yesterday villas and castles, today none owned;
Yesterday I had servants, today none served me,
Today I don't have a single battlement that I can say is mine.
Unfortunate was the hour, unfortunate was that day
in which I was born and inherit such great lordship,
Well, I had to lose everything together and in one day!
Oh death! Why don't you come and take this soul of mine
of this petty body, would you be grateful?

"Quien hubiese tal ventura 
sobre las aguas del mar
como hubo el conde Arnaldos
la mañana de san Juan! 
Con un falcon en la mano 
la caza iba a cazar,
y venir vio una galera 
que a tierra quiere llegar; 
las velas traia de seda,
la ejarcia de un cendal.
Marinero que la manda, 
diciendo viene un cantar 
que la mar ponia en alma, 
los vientos hace amamar,
los peces que andan al hondo, 
arriba los hace andar;
las aves que andan volando, 
las hace al mastil posar.
Alli habló el conde Amaldos, 
bien oireis lo que dira;
-Por Dios te ruego, marinero, 
digasme ora ese cantar.­ 
Respondióle el marinero,
tal respuesta lo fue a dar:
- Yo no digo mi canción 
sino a quien conmigo va.
","Who has ever met such fortune 
On the waters of the sea,
As the lucky Count Arnaldos
On that Saint John's day when he 
Held on his arm a falcon
As he went to chase the game! 
And he saw a splendid galley 
That to shore advancing came, 
All its fluttering sails were silken, 
All its shrouds of flounces clear,
And the sailor who was helmsman 
Sang a song so sweet to hear .
That the waves were calm and silent, 
And the noisy storm-wind hushed,
 And the fish that live the deepest
To the water's surface rushed;
While the restless birds were gathered 
Listening on the masts, and still.
From his galley Count Arnaldos 
This is how he pleaded then:
""In God's name I beg you sailor, 
Sing that song for me again."" 
But the sailor thus responded
As he drifted on the sea:
""I sing my song only for those 
Who come to sail with me.""
","Who would have such a fortune
over the waters of the sea
as there was Count Arnaldos
Saint John's morning!
With a falcon in hand
the hunt was going to hunt,
and coming he saw a galley
that wants to reach land;
The candles were made of silk,
the exercise of a cendal.
Sailor who commands it,
saying a song comes
that the sea put in the soul,
the winds make you suckle,
the fish that walk in the deep,
up he makes them walk;
the birds that fly,
He makes them pose on the mast.
Count Amaldos spoke there,
You will hear well what he will say;
-By God I pray you, sailor,
Tell me now that song.
The sailor answered him,
This was the answer he gave:
- I don't say my song
but to the one who goes with me.

"Paseabase el Rey Moro 
por la cuidad de Granada, 
desde las puertas de Elvira 
hasta las de Vivarrambla.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Cartas le fueron venidas 
que Alhama era ganada, 
las cartas echo al fuego, 
y el mensagero mataba.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Descabalga de una mula, 
y en un caballo cabalga. 
Por el Zacatin arriba
subido se habia el Alhambra,
iAy de mi Alhama!

Como en el Alhambra estuvo, 
al mismo punto mandaba
que se toquen las trompetas 
con añafiles de plata.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Y que atambores de guerra 
apriesa toque al arma;
por lo que oigan sus moros, 
los de la Vega y Granada.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Los moros que el son oyeron, 
que al sangriento Marte llama, 
uno a uno, y dos a dos,
un gran escuadrón formaba.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Alli habló un moro viejo; 
desta manera hablaba: 
Para que nos llamas, Rey? 
Para que es esta llamada?
iAy de mi Alhama!

Habeis de saber, amigos, 
una nueva desdichada:
que cristianos, con braveza, 
ya nos han tornado Alhama.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Alli habló un viejo Alfaqui 
de barba crecida y cana: 
bien se te emplea, buen rey,
buen rey, bien se te empleaba. 
iAy de mi Alhama!

Mataste los Abencerrages, 
que eran la flor de Granada; 
cogiste los tomadizos
de Cordoba la nombrada.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Por eso mereces, rey, 
una pena bien doblada;
que te pierdas tu y el reino, 
y que se pierda Granada.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Si no se respetan leyes, 
es ley que todo se pierda; 
y que se pierda Granada, 
y que te pierdas en ella.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Fuego por los ojos vierte. 
el rey que esto oyera.
Y como el otro de leyes 
de leyes tambien hablaba.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Sabe un rey que no hay leyes 
de darle a reyes disgusto.
Eso dice el rey moro 
relinchando de cólera.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Moro Alfaqui, moro Alfaqui, 
el de la vellida barba,
el rey te manda prender, 
por la perdida de Alhama.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Y cortarte la cabeza,
y ponerla en el Alhambra, 
por que a ti castigo sea,
y otros tambien en miralle.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Caballeros, hombres buenos, 
decid de mi parte al rey,
al rey moro de Granada, 
como no le debo nada.
iAy de mi Alhama!

De haberse Alhama perdido, 
a mi me pesa en el alma.
Que si el rey perdió su tierra, 
otros mucho mas perdieron.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Perdieron hijos padres, 
y casados las casadas:
Las cosas que mas amaba 
perdió el uno, y el otro fama.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Perdi una hija doncella 
que era la flor desta tierra, 
den doblas daba por ella, 
no me las estimo en nada.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Diciendo asi el viejo Alfaqui, 
le cortaron la cabeza,
y la elevan al Alhambra, 
asi como el rey lo manda.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Hombres, niños y mujeres, 
lloran tan grande perdida. 
Lloraban todas las damas 
cuantas en Granada habìa.
iAy de mi Alhama!

Por las calles y ventanas 
mucho luto parecia:
Llora el rey como fembra, 
que es mucho lo que perdia.
iAy de mi Alhama!
","The Moorish king rides up and down
 Through Granada's royal town;
From Elvira's gates to those 
Of Bivarambla on he goes.
Woe is me, Alhama!

Letters to the monarch tell 
How Alhama's city fell;
In the fire the scroll he threw, 
And the messenger he slew.
Woe is me, Alhama!

He quits his mule, and mounts his horse, 
And through the street directs his course; 
Through the street of Zacatin
To the Alhambra spurring in.
Woe is me, Alhama!

When the Alhambra walls he gained, 
On the moment he ordained
That the trumpet straight should sound
With the silver clarion round. 
Woe is me, Alhama!

And when the hollow drums of war 
Beat the loud alarm afar,
That the Moors of town and plain 
Might answer to the martial strain,-
Woe is me, Alhama!

Then the Moors, by this aware
That bloody Mars recalled them there, 
One by one, and two by two,
To a mighty squadron grew.
Woe is me, Alhama!

Out then spake an aged 
Moor In these words the king before: 
""Wherefore call on us,O King?
What may mean this gathering?"" 
Woe is me, Alhama!

""Friends! ye have, alas! to know 
Of a most disastrous blow,-
That the Christians, stern and bold, 
Have obtained Alhama's hold.""
Woe is me, Alhama!

Out then spake old Alfaqui, 
With his beard so white to see:
""Good King, thou art justly served,­
 Good King, this thou hast deserved.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""By thee were slain, in evil hour, 
The Abencerrage, Granada's flower; 
And strangers were received by thee, 
Of Cordova the Chivalry.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""And for this,O King, is sent 
On thee a double chastisement:
Thee and thine, thy crown and realm 
One last wreck shall overwhelm.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""He who holds no laws in awe 
He must perish by the law;
And Granada must be won 
And thyself with her undone.""
Woe is me, Alhama!

Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes; 
The monarchs wrath began to rise.
Because he answered, and because 
He spake exceeding well of laws.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""There is no law to say such things 
As may disgust the ear of kings"":­ 
Thus, snorting with his choler, said
The Moorish king. and doomed him dead.
Woe is me, Alhama!

Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui! 
Though thy beard so hoary be,
The king hath sent to have thee seized, 
For Alhama's loss displeased;-
Woe is me, Alhama!

And to fix thy head upon
High Alhambra's loftiest stone:
That this for thee should be the law, 
And others tremble when they saw.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""Cavalier! and man of worth!
Let these words of mine go forth; 
Let the Moorish monarch know, 
That to him I nothing owe.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""But on my soul Alhama weighs, 
And on my inmost spirit preys; 
And if the king his land hath lost, 
Yet others may hve lost the most.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""Sires have lost their children,-wives, 
Their lords,-and valiant men, their lives; 
One what best his love might claim
Hath lost,-another, wealth or fame.
Woe is me, Alhama!

""I lost a damsel in that hour,
Of all the land the loveliest flower; 
Doubloons a hundred I would pay,
And think her ransom cheap that day."" 
Woe is me, Alhama!

And as these things the old Moor said, 
They severed from the trunk his head; 
And to the Alhambra's wall with speed 
'Twas carried, as the king decreed.
Woe is me, Alhama!

And men and infants therein weep 
Their loss, so heavy and so deep; 
Granada's ladies, all she rears 
Within her walls, burst into tears.
Woe is me, Alhama!

And from the windows o'er the walls 
The sable web of mourning falls,
The king weeps as a woman o'er 
His loss,-for it is much and sore.
Woe is me, Alhama!
","The Moorish King was walking
through the city of Granada,
from the doors of Elvira
even those of Vivarrambla.
Oh my Alhama!

Letters were sent to him
that Alhama was won,
I throw the letters into the fire,
and the messenger killed.
Oh my Alhama!

Dismount from a mule,
and on a horse he rides.
Through the Zacatin above
The Alhambra had gone up,
Oh my Alhama!

As he was in the Alhambra,
at the same point he sent
let the trumpets be played
with silver añafiles.
Oh my Alhama!

And what drums of war
quickly touch the weapon;
from what their Moors hear,
those of La Vega and Granada.
Oh my Alhama!

The Moors that he heard,
that calls to the bloody Mars,
one by one, and two by two,
a large squadron formed.
Oh my Alhama!

There an old Moor spoke;
This is how he spoke:
Why are you calling us, King?
What is this call for?
Oh my Alhama!

You must know, friends,
a new misfortune:
that Christians, with bravery,
They have already taken us back to Alhama.
Oh my Alhama!

There spoke an old Alfaqui
with a grown beard and gray hair:
You are well used, good king,
good king, you were well used.
Oh my Alhama!

You killed the Abencerrages,
that they were the flower of Granada;
you took the tomadizos
from Cordoba the named one.
Oh my Alhama!

That's why you deserve, king,
a well-folded penalty;
may you and the kingdom be lost,
and let Granada be lost.
Oh my Alhama!

If laws are not respected,
It is law that everything is lost;
and let Granada be lost,
and get lost in it.
Oh my Alhama!

Fire pours through the eyes.
the king to hear this.
And like the other of laws
He also talked about laws.
Oh my Alhama!

A king knows that there are no laws
to displease kings.
That's what the Moorish king says
neighing in anger.
Oh my Alhama!

Moro Alfaqui, Moro Alfaqui,
the one with the hairy beard,
The king orders you to be arrested,
for the loss of Alhama.
Oh my Alhama!

And cut off your head,
and put it in the Alhambra,
because to you be punishment,
and others also in miralle.
Oh my Alhama!

Gentlemen, good men,
tell the king on my behalf,
to the Moorish king of Granada,
since I don't owe him anything.
Oh my Alhama!

If Alhama had been lost,
It weighs on my soul.
That if the king lost his land,
others lost much more.
Oh my Alhama!

Fathers lost children,
and married the married:
The things I loved most
one lost, and the other fame.
Oh my Alhama!

I lost a maiden daughter
that was the flower of this earth,
give doubles for her,
I don't value them at all.
Oh my Alhama!

Old Alfaqui saying this,
they cut off his head,
and they raise it to the Alhambra,
just as the king commands.
Oh my Alhama!

Men, children and women,
They cry for such a great loss.
All the ladies were crying
How many in Granada there were.
Oh my Alhama!

Through the streets and windows
it seemed like a lot of mourning:
The king cries like a woman,
That's what I lost a lot.
Oh my Alhama!

"La mañana de San Juan, 
al punto que alboreaba,
grande fiesta hacen los moros 
por la Vega de Granada.
Revolviendo sus caballos, 
jugando van de las lanzas, 
ricos pendones en ellas, 
labrados por sus amadas.
Ricas aljabas vestidas 
de oro y seda labradas:
El moro que amores tiene, 
alli bien se señalaba.
Y el moro que no los tiene, 
de tenerlos procuraba: 
Mirando las damas moras 
desde las torres de Alhambra, 
entre las cuales habia
dos de amor muy lastimadas, 
la una se llama Jarifa,
Ia otra Fatima se llama. 
Solian tratar amores, 
aunque ahora no se hablan; 
Jarifa, llena de celos,
a Fatima le hablaba:
-Ay Fatima, hermana mia, 
cómo estas de amor tocada! 
Solias tener colores,
veo que ahora te faltan. 
Solias tratar amores, 
ahora obras y callas; 
pero si le quieres ver, 
asómate a esa ventana, 
y veras a Abindarraez
y su gentileza y gala.­ 
Fatima, como discreta, 
de esta manera le habla:
-No estoy tocada de amores, 
ni en mi vida los tratara;
si se perdió mi color, 
tengo de ello justa causa. 
Por la muerte de mi padre, 
que aquel Alabez matara; 
y si amores yo quisiera, 
esta, hermana, confiada.
Que alli veo caballeros 
en aquella vega Ilana,
de quien pudiera servirme, 
y dellos ser muy amada.
De tanto valor y esfuerzo, 
cual de Abindarraez alabas.­ 
Conesto las damas moras 
pusieron fin a su habla.
","On the morn of John the Baptist, just at the break of day,
The Moors upon Granada's fields streamed out in bright array.        .        .
Their horses galloped o'er the sod, their lances flashed in air,
And the banners that their dames had wrought spread out their colors fair.
Their quivers bright flashed in the light with gold and silk brocade,
And the Moor who saw his love was there looked best in the parade,
And the Moor who had no lady love strove hard some love to gain.
'Mong those who from Alhambra's towers gazed on that warrior train
There were two Moorish ladies there whom love had smitten sore;
Zarifa one, and Fatima the name the other bore.
Knit by warm friendship were their hearts till, filled with jealous pain,
Their glances met, as one fair knight came, prancing o'er the plain.
Zarifa spoke to Fatima, ""How has love marred thy face!
Once roses bloomed on either cheek, now lilies take their place;
And you, who once would talk of love, now still and silent stay.
Come, come unto the window and watch the pageant gay! 
Abindarraez is riding by; his train is full in view;
In all Granada none can boast a choicer retinue."" 
Fatima then discreetly spoke, and without more ado: 
""It is not love, Zarifa, that robs my cheek of rose;
No fond and anxious passion this mournful bosom knows;
My cheeks are pale and I am still and silent, it is true,­ 
For, ah! I miss my father's face, whom fierce Alabey slew.
And did I crave the boon of love, a thousand knights were fain
To fight for me in service true on yonder flowery plain. 
And all the love I give to each to give me back again.
And for Abindarraez, whose heart and valiant might,
You praise and from the window watch, with rapturous dehght-""
The lady stopped, for at their feet knelt down the well-loved knight.
","The morning of San Juan,
to the point that it dawned,
the Moors have a big party
through the Vega de Granada.
Stirring their horses,
playing spears,
rich banners in them,
carved by their loved ones.
Rich dressed quivers
of carved gold and silk:
The Moor, what loves does he have?
It was well pointed out there.
And the Moor who does not have them,
To have them I tried:
Watching the Moorish ladies
from the towers of Alhambra,
among which there was
two of love very hurt,
one is called Jarifa,
The other one is called Fatima.
They used to treat loves,
although now they don't speak;
Jarifa, full of jealousy,
He spoke to Fatima:
-Oh Fatima, my sister,
how are you in love touched!
You used to have colors,
I see that now you are missing.
You used to treat loves,
now you work and remain silent;
but if you want to see him,
look out that window,
and you will see Abindarraez
and his kindness and finery.
Fatima, as discreet,
This is how he speaks to him:
-I'm not touched by love,
I would not even treat them in my life;
if my color was lost,
I have just cause for it.
For the death of my father,
that that Alabez would kill;
and if loves I wanted,
This, sister, is confident.
I see there gentlemen
in that plain Ilana,
who could help me,
and they will be very loved.
With so much value and effort,
Which of Abindarraez do you praise?
I tell the Moorish ladies

"Ponte a las rejas azules, deja la manga que labras. 
Melancólica Jarifa, verás al galán Audalla. 
que nuestra calle pasea en una yegua alazana, 
con un jaez verde oscuro, 
Si sales presto, Jarifa. verás cómo corre y para, 
que no lo iguala en Jerez ningún ginete de fama. 
Hoy ha sacado tres plumas, una blanca y dos moradas, 
que cuando corre lijero, todas tres parecen blancas. 
Si los hombres le bendicen, ¡peligro corren las damas!
Bien puedes salir a verle,  que hay muchas a las ventanas. 
¡Bien siente la yegua el día que su amo viste galas, 
que va tan briosa y loca que revienta de lozana: 
Y con la espuma del freno tenidas lleva las bandas, 
que entre las peinadas crines el hermoso cuello enlazan! 
Jarifa, que al moro adora, y de sus celos se abrasa, 
los ojos en la labor, así le dice a su Aya: 
-Días ha, Celinda amiga, que sé cómo corre y para, 
quien corre al primer deseo, al segundo para el alma
¡No me mandes que le vea, pluguiera a fortuna varia, 
que como sé lo que corre, supiera lo que alcanza! 
¡Muy corrida me han tenido sus carreras y mis ansias:
Las secretas por mi pena, las públicas por mi fama! 
Por más colores de plumas no hayas miedo que allá salga, 
porque ellas son el fiador de sus fingidas palabras:
Por otras puede correr de las muchas que le alaban, 
que basta que en mi salud el tiempo toma venganza. 
","""Rise up, rise up, Xarifa! lay the golden cushion down; 
Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town! 
From gay guitar and violin the silver notes are flowing,
And the lovely lute doth speak between the trumpet's lordly blowing;
And banners bright from lattke light are waving everywhere,
And the tall, tall plume of our cousin's bridegroom floats proudly in the air:
Rise up, rise up, Xarifa! lay the golden cushion down; 
Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town!
""Arise, arise, Xarifa! I see Andalla's face,-
He bends him to the people with a calm and princely grace;
Through all the land of Xeres and banks of Guadalquivir 
Rode forth bridegroom so brave as he, so brave and lovely, never.
Yon tall plume waving o'er his brow, of purple mixed with white,
I guess 'twas wreathed by Zara, whom he will wed tonight.
Rise up, rise up, Xarifa! lay the golden cushion down; 
Rise up, come to the window, and gaze with all the town!
""What aileth thee, Xarifa?-What makes thine eyes look down?
Why stay ye from the window far, nor gaze with all the town?
I've heard you say, on many a day, -and, sure, you said the truth,-
Andalla rides without a peer among all Granada's youth.
Without a peer he rideth,-and yon milk-white horse doth go,
Beneath his stately master, with a stately step and slow: 
Then rise, O, rise, Xarifa, lay the golden cushion down;
Unseen here through the lattice, you may gaze with all the town!""
The Zegri lady rose not, nor laid her cushion down, 
Nor came she to the window to gaze with all the town;
But though her eyes dwelt on her knee, in vain her fingers strove,-
And though her needle pressed the silk, no flower Xarifa wove:
One bonny rose-bud she had traced, before the noise drew nigh;
That bonny bud a tear effaced, slow dropping from her eye.
""No, no!"", she sighs,-""bid me not rise, nor lay my cushion down,
To gaze upon Andalla with all the gazing town!""
""Why rise ye not, Xarifa, nor lay your cushion down? 
Why gaze ye not, Xarifa, with all the gazing town?
Hear, hear the trumpet how it swells, and how the people cry!
He stops at Zara's palace-gate-why sit ye still-oh, why!""
""At Zara's gate stops Zara's mate; in him shall I discover
The dark-eyed youth pledged me his truth with tears, and was my lover?        .
I will not rise with weary eyes, nor lay my cushion down,
To gaze on false Andalla with all the gazing town!""

","Get behind the blue bars, leave the sleeve you work on.
Melancholic Jarifa, you will see the gallant Audalla.
that our street walks on a chestnut mare,
with a dark green jacket,
If you come out quickly, Jarifa. you will see how it runs and stops,
which no famous rider can match in Jerez.
Today he has produced three feathers, one white and two purple,
that when it runs fast, all three look white.
If men bless him, the ladies are in danger!
You may as well go out and see him, there are many in the windows.
The mare feels well the day her master dresses up,
that is so spirited and crazy that it bursts with freshness:
And with the brake foam attached, take the bands,
that between the combed manes the beautiful neck is linked!
Jarifa, who adores the Moor, and is burned with jealousy,
eyes on the work, this is what he tells his Aya:
-Days ago, Celinda friend, I know how to run and stop,
who runs to the first desire, to the second for the soul
Don't tell me to see him, as luck would have it,
That since I know what runs, I would know what reaches!
Their races and my desires have had me very excited:
The secret ones because of my sorrow, the public ones because of my fame!
No matter how many colors of feathers you have, don't be afraid that it will come out there,
because they are the guarantor of their false words:
For others he can run from the many who praise him,
It's enough that time takes revenge on my health.

"Si te durmieras, morena, 
ten aviso que es el sueño 
la mitad de nuestra vida, 
que se nos pasa corriendo; 
y que es tan veloz volando, 
como ligera durmiendo; 
tan breve en la juventud, 
como cuando somos viejos, 
porque el desengaño triste 
de nuestro curso ligero, 
cuando quiere despertarnos, 
llega tarde y sin provecho. 
Tu juventud y hermosura 
no es más que un mercader nuevo, 
que de rico queda pobre 
con el discurso del tiempo: 
Es una gloria del mundo, 
y de los ojos un velo, 
y un grillo para los pies, 
y esposas para los dedos; 
una ocasión de peligros, 
y de la envidia un terrero; 
un verdugo de los hombres, 
famoso ladrón del tiempo. 
Cuando la muerte baraja 
a los hermosos y feos, 
en la estrecha sepultura 
no se conocen los huesos; 
y aunque el ciprés sea más alto, 
y más hermoso sea el cedro, 
no por eso su carbón 
es más blanco que el del fresno; 
que en esta mísera vida 
nos viene el placer a sueños, 
y el disgusto y los pesares 
cuando estamos más despiertos.

If you are asleep, be warned: 
Half of your life is a dream 
Which runs and slips by us, 
As rapid in its flight
As a light sleep is wakened, 
As brief while we are young 
As when age is upon us, 
For the sad disclosure
Of our fleet career
When it would wake us comes 
Late and avails us nothing.
Your youth and beauty are
No more than a new merchant, 
Rich to be left poor
By the lapse of time; 
A glory of the world 
And a veil for the eyes
And chains for the feet 
And fetters for the fingers; 
A ground for hazards,
A midden of envy, 
A butcher of men,
A famous thief of time. 
When death has shuffled 
Ugly and fair together
In the narrow sepulcher
The bones do not know each other. 
And though the cyprus is higher 
And the cedar more lovely, neither 
Burned into charcoal, is whiter 
Than charcoal from the ash tree.
For in this woeful existence
Delight comes to us in dreams only 
And distress and tribulation
When we are widest awake. 
Dry autumn will consume 
The flower of fresh April, 
To unloved ivory
Turning your ebon hair.
","If you fell asleep, brunette,
be warned that it is the dream
half of our life,

of our light course,
when he wants to wake us up,
arrives late and without benefit.

He is nothing more than a new merchant,
how rich remains poor
with the speech of time:

and a shackle for the feet,
and finger cuffs;
an occasion of danger,
and a land of envy;
an executioner of men,
famous thief of time.
When death shuffles
to the beautiful and the ugly,
in the narrow grave
the bones are not known;
and although the cypress is taller,
and the cedar is more beautiful,
not for that reason its coal
It is whiter than that of the ash tree;
that in this miserable life
pleasure comes to us in dreams,
and the displeasure and the regrets
when we are most awake.

the burning dry autumn,
that in white and malquisto ivory
turns ebony black.

"Descolorida zagala, 
a quien tristezas hicieron 
perder el color de rosa 
en el abril de su tiempo: 
Toda la aldea murmura 
tan melancólico extremo, 
y dicen que tanto mal 
es del alma y no del cuerpo 
si ya vuestra condición 
y vuestros ojos risueños, 
que mataban de alegría, 
están de tristeza muertos; 
si ya no sales al baile, 
y el repique del pandero 
decís que tañe a difunto, 
y que es campana de entierro; 
si cuando todas las mozas 
van al campo a coger berros, 
y a despojar de su fruta 
a los tempranos almendros, 
os estáis en vuestra choza 
en un oscuro aposento, 
que aunque el sol está con vos 
está de nubes cubierto, 
¿Quién ha de haber que no diga 
que os quejáis del lado izquierdo, 
y que tan poco os conozco, 
porque tan poco os merezco, 
que os dejo, y busco mi gusto 
en partes que no le tengo; 
y que por ratos hurtados 
seguras noches desprecio, 
y que trato mal vuestra alma, 
y vos peor vuestro cuerpo, 
pues por purgarle de amor 
le dais jarabes de celos? 
Despertad, zagala mía, 
de ese profundo silencio, 
que la aldea me maldice, 
y me mira mal mi suegro.
Para el día que pongáis 
la bella planta en el suelo, 
os tengo verdes servillas, 
y mi propia boca os tengo; 
sayuelo de grana blanca 
ha de cubrir vuestro cuerpo, 
que más de cuatro os le envidien, 
y aun a mí, que le poseo. 
Tendréis zarcillos de vidrio, 
y no los quebreís os ruego, 
que son palabras de vidrio 
y las que doy no las quiebro; 
y si no pensáis cobrar 
salud, por quien yo la pierdo, 
dadme el mal, señora mía,

mejor es que esté yo enfermo;

yo sí, que soy vuestro cuerpo. 
","Oh pale maiden, 
Sadness has faded
The rose of your face
In the April of your days, 
All the village wonders 
At such melancholy;
Such suffering, they say,
Is of the soul, not the body. 
If such is your condition,
If your bewitching eyes 
Which once killed with joy 
Are now dead with sadness,
If you never go out to the dancing, 
And to you the tambourine
Sounds like a knell tolling 
And a bell at a burying,
If when all the girls 
Go out into the fields
For cresses and to plunder
The young almonds of their kernels 
You remain in your little house
In a lightless room
So that even when the sun shines 
You are clouded over,
Who will fail to say
That you suffer on your left side 
And are little seen because
You merit no better acquaintance,
That I leave you and seek my pleasure 
Where I have none
Often stealing away
In scorn of quiet nights, 
That I ill-treat your soul
And that you are worse to your body 
Since to purge it of love
You dose it with desire? 
Come awake, my girl,
Wake out of your deep silence, 
For the village speaks ill of me 
And so do your father's eyes.
I have green slippers waiting for you 
For the day when you set
Your fair foot on the floor, 
And my mouth awaits you. 
A uttle gown of light crimson 
Will cover your body
Which more than four covet 
As do I, who possess it.
You will have earrings of crystal 
Which I pray you not to break
For words are of crystal, and those 
Which I give I do not break.
And if still you will not recover
Your health, you for whom I lose mine, 
Then give me the illness, my lady,
Or let us share it between us,
For if you must be ill I would rather 
That I were the sufferer;
Not you, who are my soul, 
But I, who am your body.


","Discolored girl,
to whom sadness did
lose the rosy color
In the April of his time:
The whole village murmurs
so melancholy extreme,
and they say how bad it is
It is from the soul and not from the body
yes your condition
and your smiling eyes,
that killed with joy,
They are sadly dead;
If you don't go out to the dance anymore,
and the ringing of the tambourine
you say that it sounds like the deceased,
and that it is a burial bell;
yes when all the girls
They go to the fields to pick watercress,
and to strip away its fruit
to the early almond trees,
you are in your hut
in a dark room,
that although the sun is with you
It is covered in clouds,
Who is there that does not say
that you complain about the left side,
and how little I know you,
because I deserve you so little,
I leave you, and I look for my taste
in parts that I don't have;
and that for stolen moments
safe nights of contempt,
and that I treat your soul badly,
and your body is worse,
Well, to purge him of love
Do you give him jealousy syrups?
Wake up, my girl,
of that deep silence,
that the village curses me,
and my father-in-law looks at me badly.
For the day you set
the beautiful plant on the ground,
I have green napkins for you,
and I have my own mouth for you;
white grana tutu
It has to cover your body,
that more than four envy you,
and even to me, who possesses him.
You will have glass tendrils,
and do not break them I beg you,
what are glass words
and those that I give I do not break;
and if you don't plan to charge
health, for whom I lose it,
give me evil, my lady,
or let's split it in the middle;
that if you are sick you must be,
It is better that I be sick;
Not you, you are my soul,
Yes, I am your body.

"Rio verde, rio verde, quanto cuerpo en ti se bana de Christianos y de Moros muertos por la dura espada!
Y tus ondas cristalinas
de roxa sangre se esmaltan: entre Moros y Christianos muy gran batalla se trava. Murieron Duques y Condes, grandes senores de salva: murió gente de valia
de la nobleza de Espana. En ti murió don Alonso, que de Aguilar se llamaba; el valeroso Urdiales,
con don Alonso acababa.
Por un ladera arriba
el buen Sayavedra marcha; natural es de Sevilla,
de la gente mas granada. Tras el iba un Renegado. desta manera le habla; date, date, Sayavedra, no huyas de la Batalla.
Yo te conozco muy bien,
gran tiempo estuve en tu casa; y en la Plaça de Sevilla
bien te vida jugar canas. Conozco a tu padre y madre, y a tu muger dona Clara; siete anos fui tu cautivo, malamente me tratabas.
Y aora lo seras mio,
si Mahoma me ayudara; y tambien te tratare, como a mi me tratabas. Sayavedra que lo oyera, al Moro bolbió la cara; Tiróle el Moro una flecha, pero nunca le acertaba.
Hirióle Sayavedra
de una herida muy mala: muerto cayó el Renegado sin poder hablar palabra. Sayavedra fue cercado de mucha Mora canalla, y al cabo cayó alli muerto
de una muy mala lançada. Don Alonso en este tiempo bravamente peleava,
y el cavallo le avian muerto. y le tiene por muralla.
Mas cargaron tantos Moros que mal le hieren y tratan: De la sangre, que perdia, Don Alonso se desmaya.
Al fin, al fin cayó muerto al pie de un pen.a alta.

","Gentle river, gentle river,
Lo, thy streams are stain'd with gore, Many a brave and noble captain Floats along thy willow'd shore.
All beside thy limpid waters, • All beside thy sands so bright,
Moorish Chiefs and Christian Warriors Join'd in fierce and mortal fight.
Lords, and dukes, and noble princes On thy fatal banks were slain:
Fatal banks that gave to slaughter All the pride and flower of Spain.
There the hero, the brave Alonzo Full of wounds and glory died: There the fearless Urdiales
Fell a victim by his side.
Lo! where yonder Don Saavedra Thro' their squadrons slow retires; Proud Seville, his native city, Proud Seville his worth admires.
Close behind a renegado
Loudly shouts with taunting cry; Yield thee, yield thee. Don Saavedra, Dost thou from the battle fly?
Well I know thee, haughty Christian, Long I liv'd beneath thy roof;
Oft I've in the lists of glory
Seen thee win the prize of proof.
Well I know thy aged parents, Well thy blooming bride I know; Seven years I was thy captive, Seven years of pain and woe.
May our prophet grant my wishes, Haughty chief, thou shalt be mine: Thou shalt drink that cup of sorrow, Which I drank when I was thine.
Like a lion turns the warrior, Back he sends an angry glare:
Whizzing came the Moorish javelin, Vainly whizzing through the air.
Back the hero full of fury
Sent a deep and mortal wound: Instant sunk the Renegado, Mute and lifeless on the ground.
With a thousand Moors surrounded, Brave Saavedra stands at bay: Wearied out but never daunted, Cold at length the warrior lay.
Near him fighting great Alonzo Stout resists the Paynim bands:
From his slaughter'd steed dismounted Firm intrench'd behind him stands.
Furious press the hostile squadron, Furious he repels their rage:
Loss of blood at length enfeebles: Who can war with thousands wage!
Where yon rock the plain o'ershadows Close beneath its foot retir'd,
Fainting sunk the bleeding hero, And without a groan expir'd.
","Green river, green river, how much body in you bathes in Christians and Moors killed by the hard sword!
And your crystalline waves
They are enamelled with red blood: a great battle is going on between the Moors and the Christians. Dukes and Counts died, great lords of salvation: valuable people died
of the nobility of Spain. Don Alonso, whose name was Aguilar, died in you; the brave Urdiales,
It ended with Don Alonso.
Up a hillside
the good Sayavedra marches; He is originally from Seville,
of the greatest people. Behind him was a Renegade. This is how he speaks to him; Date, date, Sayavedra, do not flee from the Battle.
I know you very well,
I was at your house for a long time; and in the Plaça de Sevilla
It's good for you to play gray hair. I know your father and mother, and your wife, Dona Clara; For seven years I was your captive, you treated me badly.
And now you will be mine,
if Muhammad would help me; And I will also treat you, like you treated me. When Sayavedra heard it, Moro's face turned upside down; The Moor shot him an arrow, but it never hit him.
Hiriole Sayavedra
from a very bad wound: the Renegade fell dead without being able to speak a word. Sayavedra was surrounded by many Mora scoundrels, and eventually he fell there dead.
of a very bad pitch. Don Alonso bravely fought at this time,
and the horse was dead. and he has it as a wall.
But so many Moors charged that they hurt him badly and treated him: From the blood he was losing, Don Alonso faints.
Finally, he finally fell dead at the foot of a high mountain.
-Don Alonso is dead. eternal fame will win.

To tell of all the treachery that thou hast shown to me.

That she who chides her lover, forgives him ere he goes.
""Thou hast called me oft the flower of all Granada's maids,

Alas! if they but knew thee, as mine it is to know,
They well might see another mark to which thine arrows go;
But thou giv'st me little heed-for I speak to one who knows

to suffer and cry
external cause and own damage,
your pleasure and my regret,
you welcome my enemies,
because you finally know
that when they cannot works.
words will kill me.
Dubious suspicions were
cause of all my evil;
and jealousy discovered
convalescing they go.
I want to shout to heaven;
but it is better to remain silent,
because in the end whoever says insults
He is close to forgiving.”
So Fatima complains
to the brave Reduan,
in the garden of the Alhambra
at the foot of a green myrtle tree.
The Moor who is without guilt,
although it is not without sorrow,
take hold of the white hand,
and this is how he begins to speak:
-Cease, beautiful stars,
that it is not good that you cry more,
If you call me a stone,
in stones you make a sign;
and do not think that I am wronged
of insults that you say to me,
because in the end whoever says insults
He is close to forgiving.",,William Cullen Bryant,fifteenth_cent

A la voz mal entonada, 
los ánimos más cobardes,

con mil penachos vistosos 
adornados los turbantes, 
y siguiendo las banderas 
van diciendo sin pararse:

que ven el lobo delante, 
las bellas y hermosas moras 
llenan de quejas el aire; 
y aunque con femenil pecho 
la que más puede más hace; 
pidiendo favor al cielo 
van diciendo por las calles: 
""¡Al arma, capitanes,

Acudieron al asalto 
los moros más principales. 
formándose en escuadrón 
del vulgo y particulares;

","The warden of Molina, ah! furious was his speed,
As he dashed his glittering rowels in the flank of his good steed,
And his reins left dangling from the bit, along the white highway,
For his mind was set to speed his horse, to speed and not to stay.
He rode upon a grizzled roan, and with the wind he raced,
And the breezes rustled round him like a tempest in the waste.
In the Plaza of Molina at last he made his stand, 
And in a voice of thunder he uttered his command:
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions, trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.
""Now leave your feasts and banquetings and gird you in your steel!
And leave the couches of delight, where slumber's charm you feel;
Your country calls for succor, all must the word obey, 
For the freedom of your fathers is in your hands to-day. 
Ah, sore may be the struggle, and vast may be the cost; 
But yet no tie of love must keep you now, or all is lost.
In breasts where honor dwells there is no room in times like these
To dally at a lady's side, kneel at a lady's knees.
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.
""Yes, in the hour of peril away with pleasure's thrall!
Let honor take the lance and steed to meet our country's call.
For those who craven in the fight refuse to meet the foe
Shall sink beneath the feet of all struck by a bitter blow;
In moments when fair honor's crown is offered to the brave
And dangers yawn around our State, deep as the deadly grave,
'Tis right strong arms and sturdy hearts should take the sword of might,
And eagerly for Fatherland descend into the fight.
To arms, to arms, my captains. 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.
""Then Jay aside the silken robes, the glittering brocade; 
Be all in vest of leather and twisted steel arrayed;
On each left arm be hung the shield, safe guardian of the breast,
And take the crooked scimitar and put the lance in rest, 
And face the fortune of the day, for it is vain to fly,
And the coward and the braggart now alone are doomed to die.
And let each manly bosom show, in the impending fray, 
A valor such as Mars himself in fury might display.
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.
He spoke, and at his valiant words, that rang through all the square,
The veriest cowards of the town resolved to do and dare;
And stirred by honor's eager fire forth from the gate they stream,
And plumes are waving in the air, and spears and falchions gleam;
And turbaned heads and faces fierce, and smiles in anger quenched,
And sweating steeds and flashing spurs and hands in fury clenched,
Follow the fluttering banners that toward the vega swarm, 
And many a voice re-echoes the words of wild alarm.
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow;
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give the challenge to the foe.
And, like the timid lambs that crowd with bleatings in the fold,
When they advancing to their throats the furious wolf behold,
The lovely M orish maidens, with wet but flashing eyes, 
Are crowded m a public square and fill the air with cries; 
And tho', like tender women, 'tis vain for them to arm 
Yet loudly they re-echo the words of the alarm
To heaven they cry for succor, and, while to heaven they pray,
They call the nights they love so well to arm them for the fray.
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.
The foremost Moorish nobles, Molina's chosen band, 
Rush forward from the city the invaders to withstand.
There marshalled in a squadron with shining arms they speed,
Like knights and noble gentlemen, to meet their country's need.
Twelve thousand Christians crowd the plain, twelve thousand warriors tried,
They fire the homes, they reap the corn, upon the vega wide;
And in the warriors of Molina their furious lances ply,
And in their own Arabian tongue they raise the rallying cry.
To arms, to arms, my captains! 
Sound, clarions; trumpets, blow; 
And let the thundering kettle-drum 
Give challenge to the foe.

"En París está doña Alda, 
la esposa de don Roldán, 
trescientas damas con ella 
para bien la acompañar: 
todas visten un vestido, 
todas calzan un calzar, 
todas comen a una mesa, 
todas comían de un pan, 
si no era doña Alda 
que era la mayoral. 
Las ciento hilaban el oro 
las ciento tejen cendal, 
ciento tañen instrumentos 
para a doña Alda alegrar. 
Al son de los instrumentos 
doña Alda adormido se ha; 
ensoñado había un sueño, 
un sueño de gran pesar. 
Despertó despavorida 
con un dolor sin igual, 
los gritos daba tan grandes 
se oían en la ciudad. 
-¿Qué es aquesto, mi señora, 
qué es lo que os hizo mal? 
-Un sueño soñé, doncellas, 
que me ha dado gran pesar: 
que me veía en un monte, 
en un desierto lugar, 
y de so los montes altos.
un azor vide volar; 
tras dél viene una aguililla 
que lo ahincaba muy mal. 
El azor con grande cuita 
metióse so mi brial; 
el águila con gran ira 
de allí lo iba a sacar; 
con las uñas lo despluma, 
con el pico lo deshace. 
Allí habló su camarera, 
bien oiréis lo que dirá:
-Aquese sueño, señora, 
bien os lo entiendo soltar: 
el azor es vuestro esposo, 
que de España viene ya; 
el águila sodes vos, 
con la cual ha de casar, 
y aquel monte era la iglesia 
donde os han de velar. 
-Si es así, mi camarera, 
bien te lo entiendo pagar. 
Otro día de mañana 
cartas de lejos le traen; 
tintas venían de fuera, 
de dentro escritas con sangre, 
que su Roldán era muerto 
en la caza de Roncesvalles. 
","In Paris Lady Alda dwelled, 
Proud Roland's promised bnde,
Three hundred maids of honor there 
Sat with her side by side;
Of all the maidens in the land 
None fairer could you choose, 
They all had on their silken robes, 
And their embroidered shoes.
Around a single board they sat, 
A single meal to share,
But Lady Alda sat alone, 
The fairest of the fair;
A hundred wove the satin fine, 
A hundred spun the gold,
A hundred played the music sweet
That cheered her heart and soul.
And as they struck the tuneful chords, 
Their lady sank to sleep,
And while she slept she dreamed a dream, 
That almost made her weep;
With frightened eyes she wakened up, 
Her limbs quaking in fear,
She gave a cry so loud and shrill 
That the whole town could hear.
""O Lady Alda what is this? 
What is that fearful cry?""
""O maidens what a dream I've had, 
I thought that I would die!
I found myself upon a hill 
In a deserted place,
And then I saw a wild hawk fly 
And from my hillock race.
A fierce eagle was in pursuit, 
And sought to strike him down,
The panting hawk a shelter sought 
Beneath my silken gown;
The furious eagle drew him forth, 
While the poor hawk did shriek, 
And struck its claws into his plumes, 
And tore him with its beak.""
""O Lady!"" said her waiting maid, 
""This dream is plain to me;
The wild hawk is thy noble spouse 
Who came across the sea;
The eagle is thy royal self 
With whom he is to wed,
The high hill is the holy Church, 
Where nuptials will be said.""
""If this be true, dear friend of mine, 
I shall reward thee well;""
But morning dawned and letters came 
In blood their words did tell
A tale of woe, a dismal tale,
That rang throughout the halls,
Her peerless Roland had been slain 
By Moors at Roncesvalles.
","Doña Alda is in Paris,
Don Roldán's wife,
three hundred ladies with her
for good to accompany her:
everyone wears a dress,
everyone wears one shoe,
everyone eats at one table,
They all ate from one loaf,
If it wasn't Mrs. Alda
which was the mayoral.
Hundreds spun gold
the hundred weave cendal,
hundred play instruments
to cheer up Mrs. Alda.
To the sound of the instruments
Doña Alda has fallen asleep;
dreamed there was a dream,
a dream of great regret.
She woke up terrified
with unparalleled pain,
the screams were so loud
could be heard in the city.
-What is this, my lady,
What did you do wrong?
-I dreamed a dream, maidens,
which has given me great regret:
that I saw myself on a mountain,
in a desert place,
and of them the high mountains.
a goshawk saw flight;
after him comes a little eagle
that he stuck it very badly.
The goshawk with great trouble
he got into my brial;
the eagle with great anger
I was going to get it from there;
with his nails he plucks it,
with his beak he undoes it.
There his waitress spoke,
well you will hear what he will say:
-That dream, lady,
Well I understand it, let it out:
the goshawk is your husband,
that it already comes from Spain;
the eagle is you,
with whom he is to marry,
and that mountain was the church
where they have to watch over you.
-If so, my waitress,
Well I understand paying you.
another day tomorrow
letters from afar bring him;
inks came from outside,
from inside written with blood,
that his Roldán was dead
in the Roncesvalles hunt.

how beautiful and beautiful she is!
You say, the sailor
that you lived in the ships,
whether the ship or the sail or the star
is so beautiful.
You say, the knight

is so beautiful.
You say, the shepherd

"Alguna vez, 
O pensamiento, 
serás contento. 
Si amor cruel 
me hace guerra, 
seis pies de tierra 
podrán más que él: 
allí sin él 
y sin tormento, 
serás contento. 
Lo no alcanzado 
en esta vida, 
ella perdida 
será hallado, 
y sin cuidado 
del mal que siento, 
serás contento. ","Some day, some day, 
O troubled breast, 
Shalt thou find rest. 
If Love in thee
To grief give birth, 
Six feet of earth 
Can more than he;
There calm and free, 
And unoppressed, 
Shalt thou find rest. 
The unattained
In life at last,
When life is passed, 
Shall all be gained; 
And no more pained, 
No more distressed, 
Shalt thou find rest.








","Ever,
Or thought,
you will be happy.
Yes cruel love
makes me war,
six feet of land
They will be able to do more than him:
there without him
and without torment,
you will be happy.
The not achieved
in this life,
she lost
will be found,
and without care
of the evil that I feel,
you will be happy.",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,renaissance
"En la peña y sobre la peña 
duerme la niña y sueña. 
La niña que amor había 
de amores se trasportaba; 
con su amigo se soñaba, 
soñaba, mas no dormía; 
que la dama enamorada, 
y en la peña, 
no se duerme si amores sueña. 
El corazón se le altera 
con el sueño en que se vio; 
si no vio lo que soñó soñó 
lo que ver quisiera; 
hace representación
en la peña 
de todo el sueño que sueña. 
Sueños son que, amor, envías 
a los que traes desvelados, 
pagas despiertos cuidados 
con fingidas alegrías; 
quien muere de hambre los días, 
de noche manjares sueña, 
suso la peña. 
 
","On a rock where the moonlight gleam'd, 
The maiden slept, and the maiden dream'd.
The maiden dream'd, for love had crept 
Within her thoughtless heart, and seem'd 
To picture him of whom she dream'd.
She dream'd,-and did I say she slept?
O no! her brain with visions teem'd: 
The maiden on the rocky ground
Sleeps not, if love's wild dreams flit round.
Her heart's perplex'd by mystery,
And passing shades, and misty gleams 
And if she see not what she dreams
She dreams of what she fain would see
And 'tis her woe estranged to be,        
While on the rocky mountain laid, 
From all that cheers a love-sick maid.
And what is love, but dreams which thought, 
Wild thought carves out of passion? throwing 
Its veil aside, while, wing'd and growing,
The embryo's to existence brought,
False joys, fierce cares, with mysteries fraught; 
As who by day of hunger dies,
Dreaming of feasts at midnight lies.
","In the rock and on the rock
The girl sleeps and dreams.
The girl who loved
of loves he transported himself;
He dreamed of his friend,
I dreamed, but I did not sleep;
that the lady in love,
and on the rock,
You don't sleep if love dreams.
Your heart breaks
with the dream in which he saw himself;
If you didn't see what you dreamed, you dreamed
what I would like to see;
makes representation
on the rock
of all the dream you dream.
Dreams are that, love, you send
those you keep awake,
you pay awake care
with feigned joys;
who dies of hunger every day,
at night delicacies dream,
I use the rock.

"Hace el amor lo que quiere, 
¡mas ay! que no lo que debe. 
Ha dado amor en gustar 
de verme amando morir, 
y ansí me hace sufrir 
cuantos males puede dar: 
hace su gusto en buscar 
con que mi paciencia pruebe: 
¡mas ay! que no lo que debe. 
Ni hay mal ni desasosiego 
con que deje de ofenderme, 
y en llegando a deshacerme 
vuelve a repararme luego: 
hace que con su fuego 
como fénix me renueve, 
¡mas ay! que no lo que debe. 
Debiera al menos un día, 
pues me quiere atormentar, 
para aliviarme en penar 
darme una hora de alegría: 
mas no lo hace, y porfía: 
en hacer mi vida breve, 
¡mas ay! que no lo que debe. 
Ninguno con más cuidado 
sus banderas ha seguido, 
y en premio de lo servido 
dejándome bien pagado, 
hace por su desenfado 
que tan dura carga lleve

","Love does whate'er he likes, 'tis true, 
But never what he ought to do.
It is, I find, his royal will
That I, o'erpower'd by love, should die, 
And so 'tis his delight to fill
My cup with varied misery:
He tries my heart with every ill 
That mortal patience ever knew, 
Which surely he ought not to do!
There is no grief, there is no pain, 
Which he inflicts not: when I fall 
Subdued, he rouses me again, 
And but to visit me with all
That ever bid a heart complain:
His embers do his birth renew, 
Which, surely, they need not to do!
It would become him well to give,
For sorrows deep, and sufferings long, 
One gleam of joy, one short reprieve,
One thought of bliss 'midst misery's throng. 
But no! he flies the alternative,
And throws again the bolts he threw:­ 
He does not what he ought to do.
And ne'er a more obedient slave 
Follow'd his banners; never one
Had higher claim, or ought to have­ 
What service wrought, what duties done, 
What toils on shore, and risks on wave!
He does whate'er he will, 'tis true, 
But never what he ought to do!
","Love does what it wants,
but oh! that not what it should.
He has given love to taste
to see myself loving to die,
and so it makes me suffer
How many harms can it cause?
he likes to search
with which my patience tests:
but oh! that not what it should.
There is neither evil nor restlessness
so you can stop offending me,
and coming to undo
repair me again later:
does that with his fire
like a phoenix renew me,
but oh! that not what it should.
Should at least a day,
because he wants to torment me,
to alleviate my pain
give me an hour of joy:
but he doesn't do it, and stubbornly:
in making my life short,
but oh! that not what it should.
None with more care
their flags has followed,
and in reward for what was served
leaving me well paid,
does for his ease
how hard a burden it carries
but oh! that not what it should

que nunca logra casada, 
sino libre enamorada. 
","No! no! I'll never married be,
But love, and love, and yet be free.
I will not wear a captive's chain,
Nor own a master: they who wed, 
First go to jail, and then remain
In everlasting fetters led.
I can't imagine what they gain. 
No! no! I'll never married be,
But love, and love, and yet be free.
A wife can't out of window look
Without a husband's grumbling loud:
Each slip's recorded in a book:
I won't submit! I own I'm proud, 
Too proud such busy knaves to brook. 
No! no! I'll never married be,
But love, and love, and yet be free.
Unmarried, I command at will;
And youths press forward to obey:
I find them glad and grateful still,
And who so prompt to serve as they? 
Will lords a bride's desire fulfil?
No! no! I'll never married be,
But love, and love, and yet be free.
I often see a married pair,
I know they curse their luckless fate:
I've seen a woman tear her hair, 
And of connubial blessings prate;
Yet daily sink beneath despair. 
No! no! I'll never married be;
But love, and love, and yet be free.
","I don't want to be married,
but free in love.
I don't want to be captivated
nor get into subjection,
well the same thing is getting married
than to be sentenced to prison,
and for this reason
true I will not be married,
but free in love.
If you stand at the window
the husband is growling,
He says you are a vain woman
who is modestly lying:
I promise, well I understand this
that I will not be married,
but free in love.
If you ask a friend
something is missing for you,
is very grateful
he thinks it is what God commands him:
Well, this is what we look at
Isn't it crazy to be married?
but free in love.
The good of the married
nonstop they are fighting
renouncing his fate:
when we see them laughing
They are happy pretending
who never manages to get married,
but free in love.

y a ver los pasos por do me ha traído, 
hallo, según por do anduve perdido, 
que a mayor mal pudiera haber llegado; 
mas cuando del camino estó olvidado, 
a tanto mal no sé por dó he venido; 
sé que me acabo, y más he yo sentido 
ver acabar conmigo mi cuidado. 
Yo acabaré, que me entregué sin arte 
a quien sabrá perderme y acabarme

And to review the stages of the way,
I find from where my steps went first astray, 
They might have lost me in a darker maze:
But when these memories pass, around I gaze, 
And wonder whence could come a doom so dark­ 
I know I die, and suffer more to mark
My care conclude with my concluding race.
Yes, die I will, and so my spirit free
From her who well will know to undo and slay me 
If so she wishes, such her wish will be,
For since my own will does to death betray me, 
Hers, which is less my friend, must compass too 
My death-if not, what is it she will do?
","When I stop to contemplate my state,
and to see the steps where it has brought me,
I find, according to where I was lost,
that it could have gotten worse;
but when the path is forgotten,
to so much evil I don't know where I have come from;
I know that I am over, and I have felt more
see my care end with me.
I will end, I gave myself without art
who will know how to lose me and end me
if she wants, and will even know how to want it;
because my will can kill me,
yours, which is not so much on my part,
If he can, what will he do if not do it?

of so much good what I don't understand I think,
already taking faith as a budget.
I was not born except to love you;

A living spirit in keen lightning flies;
And by perception of my eager eyes, 
I feel it stays not till their orbs repeat
Its ardour; blandly on the track they meet,

Undone, and clamouring for the good it views:
When absent, Memory in her holy heat
Paints its passed beauty, till my soul will glow, 
Thinking it real, and divinely stirred,
On tiptoe fly to its embrace, but meeting 
Nought but repulse from its angelic foe,
Whose aspect guards the gate, it dies with beating
Its heart against it, like a captive bird.

live and burning spirits come out,
and being received by my eyes,
They pass me to where the evil is felt.
Find your way easily,

They come out of me as if lost,
called from that good that is present.
Absent in me, I imagine memory;

la dulce compañía amarga y dura, 
y duro campo de batalla el lecho.

I have fallen on such mishap, that not the pleas 
Of fancy, nor the wildest images
Can for an instant minister delight.
The green field seems a desert, starry night 
Obscure-the sprightliest conversation dead­ 
Sweet music harsh, and my most favorite bed
Of odorous violets, the hard field of fight. 
Of sleep- (if sleep I have) that part alone 
Visits my weary soul, which surely is
The frightful synonym of death, and last, 
I deem, whate'er may be my spirit's tone, 
Ere half run out its sands of weariness,
Each passing hour still heavier than the past.

I ended up in so much misfortune,
I can't imagine, even with madness,
something to be satisfied for a while.
The wide field seems narrow to me,
the clear night is dark for me,
the sweet bitter and hard company,
and the bed is a hard battlefield.
Of the dream, if there is any, that part
alone it is to be an image of death
It suits the weary soul.

Casting its sheen upon thy neck so white,
Touched by the breeze that stirs and gives them light 
Thy tresses in wild disarray do blow.
Pluck off the ripe fruit of thy joyous spring 
Before time with its swift and angry sting 
Covers thy precious head with lasting snow. 
The icy wind will chill the tender rose,
And fleeting years bring change to everything 
That Nature's law might keep its ordered flow.

the color is shown in your gesture,
and that your ardent, honest look,
it kindles the heart and restrains it;

of gold was chosen, with quick flight,
by the beautiful white neck, upright,
The wind moves, spreads and disorganizes:
take advantage of your joyful spring
the sweet fruit, before the angry time
cover the beautiful summit with snow.
The icy wind will wither the rose,
light age will change everything

Lead tyrant Pluto and stern Proserpine,
Sad and subdued with magic of their strain; 
Why will not my vexatious being, spent
In misery and in tears, to softness soothe
A bosom steeled against me? with more ruth

The voice of him that mourns himself for lost 
Than that which sorrowed for a forfeit ghost!

They descended into the realms of fear:

Grants it, although her fond affection fears
'T will double all its sufferings; reconciled 
To more appalling evils by the mild
Influence of present pity, shuts her ears
To prudence; for an hour's repose, prepares 
Long sorrow, grievous pain: I, lost and wild, 
Thus feed my foolish and infected thought 
That asks for dangerous aliment; in vain
I would with hold it; clamorous, again
It comes, and weeps, and I'm subdued, and naught 
Can o'er that childish will a victory gain:
So have despair and gloom their triumphs wrought!
","Like the tender mother that the mourner
son is with tears asking
something, of which eating,
He knows that the evil he feels must be doubled,
and that pious love does not allow him
Let him consider the damage he's doing
what he asks she does, she runs,
and doubles the evil, and appeases the accident:
So to my sick and crazy thought,
that in his harm he asks of me, I would like
remove this deadly maintenance,
but ask me, and cry every day
so much so that whatever he wants I consent to him,
forgetting his death and even mine.

Sad changes have I suffered since that day
When, in this valley, from her long loose hair, 
I bore thee, Relic of my Love! away.
Well did I then believe Diana's truth,
For soon true Love each jealous care represses; 
And fondly thought that never other youth
Should wanton with the Maiden's unbound tresses.
Here on the cold clear Ezla's breezy side 
My hand amid per ringlets wont to rove,
She proferred now the lock, and now denied, 
With all the baby playfulness of Love.
Here the false Maid, with many an artful tear, 
Made me each rising thought of doubt discover, 
And vowed and wept-till Hope had ceased to fear 
Ah me! beguiling like a child her lover.
Witness thou how that fondest falsest hair 
Has sighed and wept on Ezla's sheltered shore
And vowed eternal truth, and made me swear 
My heart no jealousy should harbor more. 
Ah! tell me! could I but believe those eyes?
Those lovely eyes with tears my cheek bedewing,
When the mute eloquence of tears and sighs 
I felt, and trusted, and embraced by ruin.

Veiling so false a mind who ever knew?
So true and yet so wretched! who has seen

How kind she was, how loved by her you knew me; 
Fly, fly vain Witness what I once have been,
Nor dare, all wretched as I am, to view me!

The Maid too well beloved sat with me, 
And with her finger traced upon the sand, 
""Death for Diana-not Inconstancy!""
And Love beheld us from his secret strand,
And marked his triumph, laughing to behold me, 
To see me trust a writing traced in sand,
To see me credit what a Woman told me!

I have seen after I saw you,
and how bad it looks there
that color of hope!

I, my Diana, watched.

And how many times crying
(jay, deceitful tears!)
asked for jealousy of things
that I was making fun of!
The eyes that killed me,
say, golden hair,
What was my fault in believing them,
Well, they assured me?
Don't you see that one day
I shed a thousand tears,
It's enough that I swore to him
What did you believe in his words?

in serving you and pleasing you,
to never forget you.

"Si el amor que me tenéis. 
Dios mío, es como el que os tengo, 
decidme, ¿en qué me detengo? 
O Vos ¿en qué os detenéis? 
-Alma, ¿qué quieres de mí? 
-Dios mío, no más que verte. 
-Y ¿qué temes más de ti? 
-Lo que más temo es perderte. 
Un amor que ocupe os pido, 
Dios mío, mi alma os tenga, 
para hacer un dulce nido 
adonde más la convenga.
Un alma en Dios escondida. 
¿qué tiene que desear 
sino amar y más amar 
y en amor toda encendida 
tornarte de nuevo a amar?  
","If, Lord, Thy love for me is strong 
As this which binds me unto Thee,
What holds me from Thee, Lord, so long, 
What holds Thee, Lord, so long from me?
O  soul, what then desirest thou?
-Lord, I would see Thee, who thus choose Thee. 
What fears can yet assail thee now?
-All that I fear is but to lose Thee.
Love's whole possession I entreat, 
Lord, make my soul Thine own abode, 
And I will build a nest so sweet
It may not be too poor for God.
A soul in God hidden from sin 
What more desires for thee remain 
Save but to love, and love again, 
And, all on flame with love within, 
Love on, and turn to love again?","Yes, the love you have for me.
My God, it's like the one I have for you,
Tell me, what do I stop at?
Or you, what do you stop at?
-Alma, what do you want from me?
-My God, nothing more than seeing you.
-And what do you fear most about yourself?
-The thing I fear most is loosing you.
A love that occupies I ask you,
My God, my soul have you,
to make a sweet nest
wherever it suits you best.
A soul hidden in God.
what do you have to want
but to love and more to love
and in love all lit
return to love again?

"Nada te turbe; 
nada te espante;

Dios no se muda,

quien a Dios tiene, 
nada le falta. 
Sólo Dios basta. ","Let nothing disturb thee, 
Nothing affright thee;
All things are passing; 
God never changeth. 
Patient endurance 
Attaineth to all things; 
Who God possesseth 
In nothing is wanting; 
Alone God sufficeth.

nothing scares you;
everything passes;
God doesn't move
patience
everything reaches,

God alone is sufficient.",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,renaissance
"Bella es mi ninfa, si los laços de oro 
al apacible viento desordena; 
bella, si de sus ojos enagena 
el altivo desdén que siempre lloro. 
Bella, si con la luz que sola adoro 
la tempestad del viento y mar serena; 
bella, si a la dureza de mi pena 
buelve las gracias del celeste coro. 
Bella si mansa, bella si terrible; 
bella si cruda, bella esquiva, y bella 
si buelve grave aquella luz del cielo 
cuya beldad humana y apacible 
ni se puede saber lo que es sin vella, 
ni vista entenderá lo que es el suelo. 
","Fair is my love, when to the summer air
She doth her locks of tangled gold unbind: 
Fair, when, relenting to my heart's despair,
She bids her stern eyes grant one glance more kind: 
Fair, when, to still the troubled waves and wind,
She bids that light break forth, which I adore: 
Fair, when her gentlest grace of heavenly mind
Hath turn'd to joy the pining grief I bore:
Fair in her mildness; fair, though harsh, before: 
Fair, cruel; fair, disdainful; fair, still fair,
E'en when my heaven seems gloom for evermore: 
But her fair smile of beauty debonaire
Can ne'er be known, till seen in its own light; 
Nor, seen, can word or thought report it right.
","Bella is my nymph, if the golden ties
it disorderes the gentle wind;
beautiful, if she deceives her eyes
the haughty disdain that I always cry.
Beautiful, yes with the light that I only adore
the storm of the wind and serene sea;
beautiful, yes to the harshness of my sorrow
Thank you from the heavenly choir.
Beautiful if meek, beautiful if terrible;
beautiful if raw, beautiful elusive, and beautiful
If that light from heaven becomes serious again
whose human and peaceful beauty
You can't even know what it is without hair,
Not even a glance will understand what the ground is.

"¡Qué descansada vida 
la del que huye el mundanal ruido, 
y sigue la escondida 
senda por donde han ido 
los pocos sabios que en el mundo han sido! 
Que no le enturbia el pecho 
de los soberbios grandes el estado, 
ni del dorado techo 
se admira, fabricado 
del sabio moro, en jaspes sustentado. 
No cura si la fama 
canta con vos su nombre pregonera; 
no cura si encarama 
la lengua lisonjera 
lo que condena la verdad sincera. 
¿Qué presta a mi contento 
si soy del vano dedo señalado, 
si en busca de este viento 
ando desalentado 
con ansias vivas, y mortal cuidado? 
¡Oh, campo! ¡Oh, monte! ¡Oh, río! 
¡Oh, secreto seguro, deleitoso!
Roto casi el navío, 
a vuestro almo reposo 
huyo de aqueste mar tempestuoso. 
Un no rompido sueño, 
un día puro, alegre, libre quiero; 
no quiero ver el ceño 
vanamente severo 
del que la sangre sube o el dinero. 
Despiértenme las aves 
con su cantar süave no aprendido, 
no los cuidados graves 
de que es siempre seguido 
quien al ajeno arbitrio está atenido. 
Vivir quiero conmigo; 
gozar quiero del bien que debo al cielo, 
a solas, sin testigo, 
libre de amor, de celo, 
de odio, de esperanzas, de recelo. 
Del monte en la ladera 
por mi mano plantado tengo un huerto, 
que con la primavera, 
de bella flor cubierto, 
ya muestra en esperanza el fruto cierto. 
Y como codiciosa 
de ver y acrecentar su hermosura, 
desde la cumbre airosa 
una fontana pura 
hasta llegar corriendo se apresura; 
y luego, sosegada, 
el paso entre los árboles torciendo, 
el suelo de pasada 
de verdura vistiendo, 
y con diversas flores va esparciendo. 
El aire el huerto orea, 
y ofrece mil olores al sentido; 
los árboles menea 
con un manso ruïdo, 
que del oro y del cetro pone olvido. 
Ténganse su tesoro 
los que de un flaco leño se confían; 
no es mío ver el lloro 
de los que desconfían 
cuando el cierzo y el ábrego porfían. 
La combatida antena 
cruje, y en ciega noche el claro día 
se torna; al cielo suena 
confusa vocería, 
y la mar enriquecen a porfía. 
A mí una pobrecilla 
mesa, de amable paz bien abastada, 
me baste; y la vajilla, 
de fino oro labrada, 
sea de quien la mar no teme airada. 
Y mientras miserable- 
mente se están los otros abrasando 
con sed insaciable 
del no durable mando, 
tendido yo a la sombra esté cantando, 
a la sombra tendido, 
de yedra y lauro eterno coronado, 
puesto el atento oído 
al son dulce, acordado, 
del plectro sabiamente meneado. ","How tranquil is the day
For him who flees the world's unseemly din, 
To seek the hidden way,
Which has throughout the years drawn in 
The wisest men who on this earth have been.
No tension in his breast
Shows envy of the grandees' proud charade; 
His heart is not impressed
With guilded ceilings made
By cunning Moors on jasper columns laid.
He does not care if fame
Should with its voice of praise revere 
The mention of his name,
Or if vain tongues hold dear
What truth condemns in words outspoken here.
What gain to my content
Should some wild finger point me out
If it is my intent
To breathless race about
Fanning the winds of anxious cares and doubt?
Oh, mountain, river, spring, 
Oh, haven, sweet and sure, 
My failing ship will bring 
Me to your bay secure,
Safe from the ocean's storms all ships endure.
Give me unbroken sleep,
A day pure, joyous, free of care, 
I shall not feel or keep
The maddening despair
Of those on birth or gold's exalted stair.
Let birds awaken me
With their untaught delightful trill
Let not my reveille
Stir anxious fears that fill
With care those subject to another's will.
I want to live alone,
Enjoying all I owe to my kind fate, 
My life wholly my own,
Free of love, zeal, and hate,
Suspicions, hope, and doubts intemperate.
Upon the mountainside
There is a garden planted by my hand;
It was my dearest pride
To view those flowers and stand
There thinking of the later fruited land.
In swift and eager haste
To cool and irrigate my little place, 
From summits proud and chaste 
A gushing spring will race
Bringing its waters to that famished space.
And there in peace and quiet,
Winding its narrow way among the trees, 
It passes in a riot,
Across green fields and leas,
Sowing bright flowers that sway kissed by the breeze.
My garden feels the wind,
And casts a thousand odors on the air; 
The leaves dance softly thinned,
And as they rustle there
Let those who hold scepters or wealth take care.
And those their treasure keep
Who trust a ship that storms made insecure; 
I see them wait and weep,
But tears will not ensure
Their faith or help them those fierce winds endure.
There is a heavy blast
When bright day turns to blind and darkest night;
It lashes at the mast,
The heavens roar with fright,
Enriching the sea waters as they smite.
Let this suffice for me:
A humble board of simple food and peace; 
Plates of gold filigree
For those who find surcease
From the dark fears that angry waves release.
While miserably the rest
Are burning with a thirst that seems to long 
For what power may attest;
Ephemeral but strong,
Here in the shade I lie and sing my song.
With mythic laurel spray
In this cool shadow I am duly crowned; 
I hear the psalter play
Stretched out upon the ground,
As l rejoice to its sweet measured sound.
","What a restful life
the one from whom the worldly noise flees,
and the hidden one continues
path where they have gone
the few wise men in the world who have been!
That doesn't make your chest cloudy
of the proud greats the state,
nor of the golden roof
admired, manufactured
of the wise Moor, supported by jaspers.
It doesn't cure if fame
sing with you his name he proclaims;
does not heal if it climbs
the flattering tongue
what condemns the sincere truth.
What lends to my contentment
If I am of the vain pointed finger,
if in search of this wind
I'm discouraged
with lively desires and mortal care?
Oh field! Oh mount! Oh river!
Oh, safe, delightful secret!
The ship was almost broken,
to your soul rest
I flee from this stormy sea.
An unbroken dream,
I want a pure, happy, free day;
I don't want to see the frown
vainly severe
from which the blood rises or the money.
Wake me up the birds
with its soft unlearned song,
not serious care
what is always followed
who is subject to another's discretion.
I want to live with me;
I want to enjoy the good that I owe to heaven,
alone, without a witness,
free of love, of zeal,
of hate, of hopes, of suspicion.
From the mountain on the slope
By my hand planted I have a garden,
that with spring,
covered with beautiful flowers,
It already shows the true fruit in hope.
And how greedy
to see and increase its beauty,
from the airy summit
a pure fountain
until he arrives running he hurries;
and then, calmly,
the passage between the trees twisting,
the ground in passing
of vegetables dressing,
and with various flowers it spreads.
The air the garden prays,
and offers a thousand smells to the sense;
the trees shake
with a gentle noise,
that forgets the gold and the scepter.
Have your treasure
those who trust in a weak log;
It is not mine to see the cry
of those who distrust
when the wind and the wind insist.
The combative antenna
creaks, and in blind night the clear day
it becomes; it sounds like heaven
confused voicing,
and the sea enriches stubbornly.
To me a poor thing
table, of kind peace well supplied,
it is enough for me; and the dishes,
of fine carved gold,
be of whom the sea does not fear in anger.
And while miserable-
mind the others are burning
with insatiable thirst
of the non-durable command,
Lying in the shade I am singing,
lying in the shade,
of ivy and eternal crowned laurel,
keeping an attentive ear
to the sweet, agreed tone,
of the wisely shaken plectrum.",,John A. Crow,renaissance
"A la Fe preguntó un Villano rústico, 
criado en el aldea, en trato bárbaro, 
una dificultad casi insolubile 
acá a nuestro entender común y párvulo: 
y fue, que como el Cuerpo real y físico 
del Sacrosanto Dios, divino farmaco, 
está en el todo, y en la parte íntegro 
después que se divide aquel Pan cándido? 
Al cual la Fe responde en breve término, 
que como en un espejo sin obstáculo, 
hecho trozos, en todas las partículas 
ve uno su rostro entero en cualquier átomo; 
del propio modo Dios en cualquier mínima 
parte del sacro Pan, tan grande, y máximo, 
esta como antes de que algún Presbítero 
le parta, o le reparta, como es árbitro. 
Si pan es lo que vemos, ¿cómo dura 
sin que comiendo de él se nos acabe? 
Si Dios, ¿cómo en el gusto a pan nos sabe? 
¿Cómo de sólo pan tiene figura? 
Si pan, ¿cómo le adora la criatura? 
Si Dios, ¿cómo en tan chico espacio cabe? 
Si pan, ¿cómo por ciencia no se sabe? 
Si Dios, ¿cómo le come su hechura? 
Si pan, ¿cómo nos harta siendo poco? 
Si Dios es, ¿cómo puede ser partido? 
Si pan, ¿cómo en el alma hace tanto? 
Si Dios, ¿cómo le miro yo y le toco? 
Si pan, ¿cómo del Cielo ha descendido? 
Si Dios. ¿cómo no muero yo de espanto? ","A rustic not conceiving in his mind 
Things plain and manifest to all mankind,
Enquired of Faith one day, why it was said 
The Almighty God was in the holy bread; 
How the uncreated, eternal, infinite God, 
Lay in a wafer, seemed exceeding odd; 
And if He is, then it must next be said, 
That God is broken with the broken bread. 
""Hast thou a broken mirror e'er espied?""
Thus bringing brief conviction, Faith replied: 
""When it is whole thine image meets thine eyes; 
In every fragrant will that image rise.
Thus when the holy Priest, as need demands, 
Divides the blessed Host with hallowed hands, 
In every atom still contained will be
The Omnipresent, Infinite Deity.""
If this be bread, why does it never waste, 
So constantly consumed, yet always here? 
If this be God, then how can it appear
Like bread we eat and seem bread to the taste? 
If bread, why is it worshipped by the baker?
If God, can such a space a God comprise? 
If bread, how is it it confounds the wise? 
If God, how is it that we eat our Maker?
If bread, what good can such a morsel do? 
If God, how can we break our Lord in two? 
If bread, such saving virtue could it give?
If God, how can I see and touch it thus?
If bread, how could it come from Heaven to us? 
If God, how can I look at it and live?""","A rustic Villain asked Faith,
raised in the village, in barbaric treatment,
an almost insoluble difficulty
here in our common and childhood understanding:
and it was, that as the real and physical Body
of the Most Holy God, divine medicine,
It is in the whole, and in the entire part
after that candid Bread is divided?
To which Faith responds in short order,
that as in a mirror without obstacle,
broken into pieces, in all the particles
one sees his entire face in any atom;
God's own way in any minimum
part of the sacred Pan, so great, and maximum,
It is like before some Priest
he splits it, or distributes it, as he is an arbiter.
If bread is what we see, how does it last
Without eating it we run out?
Yes God, how does bread taste to us?
How does it look like just bread?
If bread, how does the creature worship him?
Yes God, how does it fit in such a small space?
If bread, how can science not know?
If God, how does his workmanship eat him?
If bread, how can we be satisfied when it is little?
If God is, how can he be divided?
If bread, how does it make so much in the soul?
Yes God, how do I look at him and touch him?
If bread, how did it come down from Heaven?
If God. How do I not die of fear?",,Robert Southey,renaissance
"Alma región luciente, 
prado de bienandanza, que ni al hielo 
ni con el rayo ardiente 
falleces, fértil suelo 
producidor eterno de consuelo: 
De púrpura y de nieve 
florida la cabeza coronado, 
a dulces pastos mueve, 
sin honda ni cayado,

Ya dentro a la montaña

y lanza en aquel bien libre de tasa. 
¡Oh son, oh voz, siquiera

Land of the good whose earthly toils are o'er! 
Nor frost nor heat may blight
Thy vernal beauty, fertile shore, 
Yielding thy blessed fruits for evermore!
There, without crook or sling,
Walks the Good Shepherd; blossoms white and red 
Round his meek temples cling;
And, to sweet pastures led,
His own loved flock beneath his eye is fed.
He guides, and near him they
Follow delighted; for he makes them go 
Where dwells eternal May,
And heavenly roses blow,
Deathless, and gathered but again to grow.
He leads them to the height
Named of the infinite and long-sought Good,
And fountains of delight;
And where his feet have stood,
Springs up, along the way, their tender food.
And when, in the mid skies,
The climbing sun has reached his highest bound, 
Reposing as he lies,
With all his flock around,
He witches the still air with numerous sound.
From his sweet lute flow forth 
Immortal harmonies, of power to still 
All passions born of earth,
And draw the ardent will
Its destiny of goodness to fulfil.
Might but a little part,
A wandering breath, of that high melody 
Descend into my heart,
and change it till it be
Transformed and swallowed up, O love! in thee.
Ah! then my soul should know,
Beloved! where thou liest at noon of day; 
And from this place of woe
Released, should take its way
To mingle with thy flock, and never stray.

meadow of well-being, that not even the ice
not even with the burning lightning
you die, fertile soil
eternal producer of comfort:
Of purple and snow
flowery crowned head,
move to sweet pastures,
without sling or staff,
the good Shepherd in you his beloved flock.
He goes, and in happy pursuit
His sheep follow him, do they graze them
with immortal roses,
with a flower that is always born,
and the more you enjoy, the more you are reborn.
Already inside the mountain
He guides them from the high good; already in the vein
faithful joy bathes them,
and gives them a full table,
shepherd and pasture alone, and good luck.
And from its sphere when
the summit reaches very high
the sun, him taking a nap,
of his girded herd,
with sweet sounds delights the holy ear.
Play the sonorous rebec,
and the immortal sweetness to the soul passes,
with which he debases gold,
and burning it passes through
and throw in that good free of tax.
Oh sound, oh voice, even
small part some would descend
in my sense, and out
if the soul put
and everything in you, oh love, I would convert it!
I would know where
You rest, sweet Husband, and untied
from this prison to where
suffer, your pack
together, she will no longer be lost, wrong.",,William Cullen Bryant,renaissance
"Cuando contemplo el cielo 
de innumerables luces adornado, 
y miro hacia el suelo, 
de noche rodeado, 
en sueño y en olvido sepultado, 
el amor y la pena 
despiertan en mi pecho un ansia ardiente; 
despiden larga vena 
los ojos hechos fuente; 
la lengua dice al fin con voz doliente: 
Morada de grandeza 
templo de claridad y hermosura: 
mi alma que a tu alteza 
nació, ¿qué desventura 
la tiene en esta cárcel baja, escura? 
¡Qué mortal desatino 
de la verdad aleja ansí el sentido, 
que de tu bien divino olvidado, perdido, 
sigue la vana sombra, el bien fingido? 
El hombre está entregado 
al sueño, de su suerte no cuidando; 
y con paso callado 
el cielo, vueltas dando, 
las horas del vivir le va hurtando. 
¡Ay! despertad, mortales! 
Mirad con atención en vuestro daño. 
¿Las almas immortales, 
hechas a bien tamaño, 
podrán vivir de sombra y solo engaño? 
¡Ay!, levantad los ojos 
a aquesta celestial eterna esfera: 
burlaréis los antojos 
de aquesa lisonjera 
vida, con cuanto teme y cuanto espera. 
¿Es más que un breve punto 
el bajo y torpe suelo, comparado 
a aqueste gran trasunto, 
do vive mejorado 
lo que es, lo que será, lo que ha pasado? 
Quien mira el gran concierto 
de aquestos resplandores eternales, 
su movimiento cierto, 
sus pasos desiguales

y no gime y suspira 
por romper lo que encierra
el alma y de estos bienes la destierra?

aquí reina la paz; aquí, asentado 
en rico y alto asiento, 
está el Amor sagrado, 
de glorias y deleites rodeado. 
Inmensa hermosura 
aquí se muestra toda, y resplandece 
clarísima luz pura, 
que jamás anochece;

¡Oh, deleitosos senos! 
¡Repuestos valles, de mil bienes llenos! ","When yonder glorious sky,
Lighted with million lamps, I contemplate; 
And tum my dazzled eye
To this vain mortal state,
All dim and visionary, mean and desolate:
A mingled joy and grief
Fills all my soul with dark solicitude;­
I find a short relief
In tears, whose torrents rude
Roll down my cheeks; or thoughts which thus intrude;-
Thou so sublime abode!
Temple of light, and beauty's fairest shrine! 
My soul, a spark of God,
Aspiring to thy seats divine,
Why, why is it condemned in this dull cell to pine?
Why should I ask in vain
For truth's pure lamp, and wander here alone, 
Seeking, through toil and pain,
Light from the Eternal One,
Following a shadow still, that glimmers and is gone?
Dreams and delusions play
With man,-he thinks not of his mortal fate: 
Death treads his silent way;
The earth turns round; and then, too late,
Man finds no beam is left of all his fancied state.
Rise from your sleep, vain men!
Look round,-and ask if spirits born of heaven,
And	bound to heaven again, 
Were only lent or given
To be in this mean round of shades and follies driven.
Turn your unclouded eye
Up to yon bright, to yon eternal spheres;
And spurn the vanity
Of time's delusive years,
And all its flattering hopes, and all its frowning fears.
What is the ground ye tread,
But a mere point, compared with that vast space,
Around, above you spread, 
Where, in the Almighty's face,
The present, future, past, hold an eternal place?
List to the concert pure
Of yon harmonious, countless worlds of light!
See, in his orbit sure,
Each takes his journey bright,
Led by an unseen hand through the vast maze of night!
See how the pale Moon rolls
Her silver wheel; and, scattering beams afar 
On Earth's benighted souls,
See Wisdom's holy star;
Or, in his fiery course, the sanguine orb of War;
Or that benignant ray
Which Love hath called its own, and made so fair; 
Or that serene display
Of power supernal there,
Where Jupiter conducts his chariot through the air!
And, circling all the rest,
See Saturn, father of the golden hours:
While round him, bright and blest, 
The whole empyreum showers
Its glorious streams of light on this low world of ours!
But who to these can turn
And weigh them 'gainst a weeping world like this,­ 
Nor feel his spirit burn
To grasp so sweet a bliss,
And mourn that exile hard which here his portion is?
For there, and there alone,
Are peace, and joy, and never-dying love,­ 
There, on a splendid throne,
'Midst all those fires above,
In glories and delights which never wane nor move.
O, wondrous blessedness,
Whose shadowy effluence hope o'er time can fling! 
Day that shall never cease,-
No night there threatening,-
No winter there to chill joy's ever-during spring.
Ye fields of changeless green,
Covered with living streams and fadeless flowers!
Thou parading serene!
Eternal, joyful hours
My disembodied soul shall welcome in thy bowers!
","When I look at the sky
adorned with innumerable lights,
and I look at the ground,
at night surrounded,
in sleep and buried oblivion,
love and sorrow
They awaken a burning longing in my chest;
they say goodbye to a long vein
the eyes made fountain;
The tongue finally says with a sorrowful voice:
Abode of greatness
temple of clarity and beauty:
my soul that to your highness
was born, what misfortune
Do you have her in this low, dark prison?
What a deadly folly
from the truth thus distances the meaning,
that of your divine good forgotten, lost,
does the vain shadow follow, the feigned good?
The man is delivered
to sleep, of your fate not caring;
and with a quiet step
the sky, spinning around,
the hours of living are stolen from him.
Oh! wake up, mortals!
Look carefully at your damage.
The immortal souls,
made to a good size,
Can they live in shadow and only deception?
Oh, raise your eyes
to this eternal celestial sphere:
you will outwit the cravings
of that flattering
life, with how much it fears and how much it hopes.
Is it more than a brief point
the low and clumsy ground, compared
to this great transcript,
do lives improved
what is, what will be, what has happened?
Who watches the big concert
of those eternal radiances,
its certain movement,
his uneven steps
and in corresponding proportion as equal:
how the moon moves
the silver wheel, and goes after it
the light of knowledge rains,
and the graceful star
of Love follows her shining and beautiful;
and how another way
continues the bloody angry Mars,
and the benine Jupiter,
of property a thousand fenced,
serene the sky with its beloved lightning;
surround yourself at the top
Saturn, father of the golden centuries;
of the shining choir
His light is spreading and his treasure:
who is the one looking at this
and appreciates the lowness of the earth,
and does not moan and sigh
for breaking what it contains
the soul and banishes it from these goods?
Contentment lives here,
Peace reigns here; here, settled
in rich and high seat,
there is sacred Love,
surrounded by glories and delights.
immense beauty
here it is all shown, and it shines
very clear pure light,
that never gets dark;
Eternal spring blooms here.
Oh, true fields!
Oh, truly sweet and pleasant meadows!
Delicious miners!
Oh, delightful breasts!

"En una noche oscura, 
con ansias en amores inflamada, 
joh dichosa ventura!, 
salí sin ser notada, 
estando ya mi casa sosegada: 
a escuras y segura, 
por la secreta escala disfrazada, 
¡oh dichosa ventura!, 
a escuras y en celada, 
estando ya mi casa sosegada; 
en la noche dichosa, 
en secreto, que nadie me veía, 
ni yo miraba cosa, 
sin otra luz y guía 
sino la que en el corazón ardía. 
Aquésta me guiaba 
más cierto que la luz del mediodía, 
a donde me esperaba 
quien yo bien me sabía, 
en parte donde nadie parecía. 
¡Oh noche que guiaste!, 
¡oh noche amable más que el alborada!
¡oh noche que juntaste 
amado con amada, 
amada en el amado transformada! 
En mi pecho florido, 
que entero para él solo se guardaba, 
allí quedó dormido, 
y yo le regalaba; 
y el ventalle de cedros aire daba. 
El aire de la almena, 
cuando yo sus cabellos esparcía, 
con su mano serena 
en mi cuello hería, 
y todos mis sentidos suspendía. 
Quedéme y olvidéme, 
el rostro recliné sobre el amado, 
cesó todo, y dejéme, 
dejando mi cuidado 
entre las azucenas olvidado. ","Once in the dark of night,
When love's consuming flames enraptured me, 
Oh, fate of sweet delight!
I slipped out silently,
And left my house at peace when none could see.
In darkness and secure,
I climbed my secret stairway to the skies, 
Oh, fate joyous and pure!
Unseen and in disguise
I left my house at peace to softly rise.
That night my soul took wing,
When no one saw or knew my hidden flight,
I did not see a thing,
And had no guide or light,
Save that which in my heart was burning bright.
The light that guided me,
More surely than the scorching noonday sun, 
Led where impatiently
Waited a loving one
In a small refuge where he stood alone.
Oh, night, most holy guide,
Oh, night, more tender than the dawn's embrace, 
Oh, night, that unified
Two lovers face to face
Transforming Bride to Bridegroom in that place.
Within my flowering breast,
Which whole and safe for Him alone I kept, 
He came with me to rest,
And while in quiet he slept
The cedars fanned him as I softly stepped.
The wind from the redoubt
Blew off the stones and scattering his hair
Its hand reached out 
Serene and bare
To strike me down and leave me senseless there.
Forgetting all I strayed,	.	.
My face upon the Loved One was inclined; 
The world stood still, I prayed,
All cares to Him consigned,
And in the field of lilies lost to mind.
","On a dark night,
with longings for inflamed loves,
oh happy fortune!
I left without being noticed,
my house being already calm:
dark and safe,
by the secret disguised ladder,
Oh blessed fortune!
in the dark and in a blind spot,
my house being now calm;
in the blissful night,
secretly, that no one saw me,
I didn't even look at anything,
without other light and guidance
but the one that burned in the heart.
This one guided me
Truer than the light of noon,
where I was waiting
who I knew well,
partly where no one seemed.
Oh night that you guided!,
oh kind night more than the dawn!
oh night you put together
loved with beloved,
beloved in the beloved transformed!
In my flowery chest,
that everything was kept for him alone,
there he fell asleep,
and I gave him a gift;
and the window of cedars gave air.
The air of the battlement,
when I scattered her hair,
with his serene hand
it hurt on my neck,
and all my senses were suspended.
Stay and forget me,
I rested my face on the beloved,
everything stopped, and left me,
leaving my care
forgotten among the lilies.",,John A. Crow,renaissance

O more than pleasant wound!
And O soft hand, O touch most delicate,

With so intense a light

Which were obscure and blind, 
Now with strange glories bright,

Although by night.
I know there is no other thing so fair
And earth and heaven drink refreshment there 
Although by night.
Full well I know its depth no man can sound 
And that no ford to cross it can be found

Out of it comes the light by which we see

I know to be omnipotent in force

From source and current a new current swells 
Which neither of the other twain excels

That we with life eternal may be fed
Though it be night.

"Tras de un amoroso lance, 
y no de esperanza falto, 
volé tan alto, tan alto, 
que le dí a la caza alcance. 
Para que yo alcance diese 
a aqueste lance divino, 
tanto volar me convino, 
que de vista me perdiese; 
y con todo, en este trance 
en el vuelo quedé falto; 
mas el amor fue tan alto, 
que le dí a la caza alcance. 
Cuando más alto subía, 
deslumbróseme la vista, 
y la más fuerte conquista 
en oscuro se hacía, 
más por ser de amor el lance 
dí un ciego y oscuro salto, 
y fui tan alto, tan alto, 
que le dí a la caza alcancé. 
Cuanto más alto llegaba 
de este lance tan subido, 
tanto más bajo y rendido 
y abatido me hallaba. 
dije: No habrá quien alcance; 
y abatíme tanto, tanto, 
que fui tan alto, tan alto. 
que le dí a la caza alcance. 
Por una extraña manera 
mil vuelos pasé de un vuelo, 
porque esperanza de cielo 
tanto alcanza cuanto espera; 
esperé sólo este lance, 
y en esperar no fui falto, 
pues fuí tan alto, tan alto, 
que le dí a la caza alcance. ","Not without hope did I ascend 
Upon an amorous quest to fly 
And up I soared so high, so high, 
I seized my quarry in the end.
As on this falcon quest I flew 
To chase a quarry so divine,
I had to soar so high and fine
That soon I lost myself from view.
With loss of strength my plight was sorry 
From straining on so steep a course.
But love sustained me with such force 
That in the end I seized my quarry.
The more I rose into the height
More dazzled, blind, and lost I spun. 
The greatest conquest ever won
I won in blindness, like the night. 
Because love urged me on my way
I gave that mad, blind, reckless leap 
That oared me up so high and steep 
That m the end I seized my quarry.
The steeper upward that I flew 
On so vertiginous a quest
The humbler and more lowly grew 
My spirit, fainting in my breast.
I said 'None yet can find the way 
But as my spirit bowed more low, 
Higher and higher did I go
Till in the end I seized my prey.
By such strange means did I sustain 
A thousand starry flights in one, 
Since hope of Heaven yet by none 
Was ever truly hoped in vain.
Only by hope I won my way 
Nor did my hope my aim belie,
Since I soared up so high, so high, 
That in the end I seized my prey.
","After a loving affair,
and not lacking in hope,
I flew so high, so high,
that I gave the hunt scope.
So that I can reach
to this divine throw,
so much flying suited me,
that I was lost from sight;
and yet, in this trance
I was missing on the flight;
but love was so high,
that I gave the hunt scope.
The higher I climbed,
my vision was dazzled,
and the strongest conquest
in the dark it was done,
more because the incident is about love
I took a blind and dark leap,
and I went so high, so high,
that I gave to the hunt I caught.
The higher I got
of this very high pitch,
so much lower and surrendered
and dejected I was.
I said: There will be no one to reach;
and brought me down so, so much,
that I was so high, so high.
that I gave the hunt scope.
In a strange way
I spent a thousand flights in one flight,
because hope of heaven
He achieves as much as he hopes;
I waited only for this moment,
and in waiting I was not lacking,
Well I went so high, so high,
that I gave the hunt scope.",,Roy Campbell,renaissance
"No las damas, amor, no gentilezas 
de caballeros canto enamorados, 
ni las muestras, regalos y ternezas 
de amorosos afectos y cuidados; 
mas el valor, los hechos, las proezas 
de aquellos españoles esforzados, 
que a la cerviz de Arauco no domada 
pusieron duro yugo por la espada. 
Cosas diré también harto notables 
de gente que a ningún rey obedecen, 
temerarias expresas memorables 
que celebrarse con razón merecen, 
raras industrias, términos loables 
que más los españoles engrandecen: 
pues no es el vencedor más estimado 
de aquello en que el vencido es reputado 
Muchos hay en el mundo que han llegado 
a la engañosa alteza desta vida, 
que fortuna los ha siempre ayudado 
y dádoles la mano a la subida, 
para después de haberlos levantado, 
derribarlos con mísera caída, 
cuando es menor el golpe y sentimiento 
y menos el pensar que hay mudamiento. 
No entienden con la próspera bonanza 
que el contento es principio de tristeza, 
ni miran en la súbita mudanza 
del consumidor tiempo y su presteza; 
mas con altiva y vana confianza 
quieren que en su fortuna haya firmeza; 
la cual, de su aspereza no olvidada, 
revuelve con la vuelta acostumbrada. 
Son de gestos robustos, desbarbados, 
bien formados los cuerpos y crecidos, 
espaldas grandes, pechos levantados, 
recios miembros, de niervos bien fornidos; 
agiles, desenvueltos, alentados, 
animosos, valientes, atrevidos,
duros en el trabajo y sufridores 
de fríos mortales, hambres y calores. 
No ha habido rey jamás que sujetase 
esta soberbia gente libertada, 
ni extranjera nación que se jatase 
de haber dado en sus términos pisada, 
ni comarcana tierra que se osase 
mover en contra y levantar espada: 
siempre fue exenta, indómita, temida, 
de leyes libre y de cerviz erguida. 
Por dioses, como dije, eran tenidos 
de los indios los nuestros; pero olieron 
que de mujer y hombre eran nacidos, 
y todas sus flaquezas entendieron; 
viéndolos a miserias sometidos 
el error inorante conocieron, 
ardiendo en viva rabia avergonzados 
por verse de mortales conquistados. 
¡Oh incurable mal! ¡oh gran fatiga, 
con tanta diligencia alimentada! 
¡Vicio común y pegajosa liga, 
voluntad sin razón desenfrenada, 
del provecho y bien público enemiga, 
sedienta bestia, hidrópica, hinchada, 
principio y fin de todos nuestros males! 
¡oh insaciable codicia de mortales! 
","I sing not love of ladies, nor of fights
Devised for gentle dames by courteous knights; 
Nor feasts, nor tourneys, nor that tender care 
Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair; 
But the bold deeds of Valor's favorite train, 
Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain, 
Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace, 
And bent beneath their yoke her untamed race.
Of tribes distinguished in the field I sing; 
Of nations who disdain the name of King; 
Courage, that danger only taught to grow, 
And challenge honor from a generous foe; 
And preserving toils of purest fame,
And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name; 
For the brave actions of the vanquished spread 
The brightest glory round the victor's head.
Many there are who, in this mortal strife,
Have reached the slippery heights of splendid life: 
For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent;
Smiling she raised them up the steep ascent, 
To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat 
To which she led their unsuspecting feet; 
E'en at the moment when all fears disperse, 
And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse.
Little they think, beguiled by fair success, 
That Joy is but the herald of Distress:
The hasty wing of Time escapes their sight, 
And those dark evils that attend his flight:
Vainly they dream, with gay presumption warm, 
Fortune for them will take a steadier form;
She, unconcerned at what her victims feel, 
Tums with her wonted haste her fatal wheel.
They are of bearless cheek and robust face, 
Of bodies well-proportioned, tall and strong; 
A wide-shouldered and broad-chested race,
Muscled from head to foot, stout limbs and long, 
Courageous, agile, of swift-footed grace,
Valiant and spirited in war and song, 
Steadfast in work and able to withstand 
The bite of cold, hunger or scorching sand.
On the brave dignity of this free folk,
No king has ever thrown the servile yoke, 
Nor any foreign tribe is there to boast
Of having overrun their crags and coast;
No neighboring band could ever dare afford 
To move against this race with lifted sword: 
Free and indomitable, fearsome and proud, 
To no law subject and with heads unbowed.
The Indians first, by novelty dismayed,
As Gods revered us, and as Gods obeyed;
But when they found we were of woman born, 
Their homage turned to enmity and scorn:
Their childish error when our weakness showed, 
They blushed at what their ignorance bestowed; 
Fiercely they burnt with anger and with shame, 
To see their masters but of mortal frame.
Oh cureless malady! Oh fatal pest!
Embraced with ardor and with pride caressed, 
Thou common vice, thou most contagious ill, 
Bane of the mind, and frenzy of the will!
Thou foe to private and to public health;
Thou dropsy of the soul, that thirsts for wealth, 
lnsatiate Avarice!-'tis from thee we trace
The various misery of our mortal race.
","Not the ladies, love, not niceties
I sing of gentlemen in love,
nor the samples, gifts and kindnesses
of loving affections and care;
but the courage, the deeds, the exploits
of those hardworking Spaniards,
that the neck of Arauco not tamed
They put a hard yoke on them by the sword.
I will also say very notable things
of people who obey no king,
memorable express daredevils
that deserve to be celebrated with reason,
rare industries, laudable terms
What the Spaniards exalt the most:
because he is not the most esteemed winner
of that in which the defeated is reputed
There are many in the world who have arrived
to the deceptive highness of this life,
what fortune has always helped them
and give them your hand on the way up,
for after having lifted them,
knock them down with a miserable fall,
when the blow and feeling is less
and even less the thought that there is a change.
They do not understand the prosperous bonanza
that happiness is the beginning of sadness,
They don't even look at the sudden change
of the consumer's time and alacrity;
but with haughty and vain confidence
They want firmness in their fortune;
which, from its unforgotten harshness,
stir with the usual turn.
They have robust, unburdened gestures,
bodies well formed and grown,
big backs, raised breasts,
strong limbs, with well-built youngsters;
agile, confident, encouraged,
courageous, brave, daring,
hard at work and suffering
of deadly cold, hunger and heat.
There has never been a king who held
these proud liberated people,
nor foreign nation that boasts
of having stepped on its terms,
nor a neighboring land that dared
move against and raise sword:
It was always exempt, untamed, feared,
of free laws and with an erect neck.
They were considered gods, as I said,
ours from the Indians; but they smelled
that of woman and man were born,
and they understood all their weaknesses;
seeing them subjected to misery
they knew the innocent error,
burning with rage ashamed
to see conquered mortals.
Oh incurable evil! oh great fatigue,
with so much diligence fueled!
Common vice and sticky league,
will without unbridled reason,
of the enemy's profit and public good,
thirsty beast, dropsical, swollen,
beginning and end of all our evils!
Oh insatiable greed of mortals!

From earth's dark mansion struggles to be free 
And longs to soar away and be at rest with thee

you covered your luminous vigor for a time

Already, despising this place, do the sky

and, broken the mortal knot, you are present
to eternal peace, leaving the land at war.

to the wide fence of immortal beauty,
like earth vapor raised

in vain to flee from this narrowness,
What prevents me from being rested with you?

or the condemned rower in the galleys.
Not even the madman himself, because he was furious,
nor does he who is lost cry in a haughty state,
nor the one who brought dishonor to elusive time,
or the need to humble state.
Suffering any pain is easy;
that none torments so truly
May suffering not overcome her so much.
But he who has a jealous wife,
That one has misfortune, Algiers, galleys,
madness, perdition, disgrace and tears.

"¡Clara fuente de luz nuevo y hermoso 
rico de luminarias patrio cielo! 
¡Casa de la verdad, sin nombre o velo, 
de inteligencias ledo almo reposo! 
¡Oh, cómo allá te estás, cuerpo glorioso, 
tan lejos del mortal caduco anhelo, 
casi un Argos divino alzado a vuelo, 
de nuestro humano error libre y piadoso! 
¡Oh patria amada! a ti suspira y llora 
ésta, en su cárcel, Alma peregrina, 
llevada errando de uno en otro instante. 
Esa cierta beldad que me enamora, 
suerte y sazón me otorgue tan benina, 
que do sube el amor llegue el amante. ","Clear fount of light! my native land on high, 
Bright with a glory that shall never fade!
Mansion of truth! without a veil or shade, 
Thy holy quiet meets the spirit's eye.
There dwells the soul in its ethereal essence, 
Gasping no longer for life's feeble breath;
But, sentinelled in heaven, its glorious presence
With pitying eye beholds, yet fears not, death. 
Beloved country! banished from thy shore,
A stranger in this prison-house of clay, 
The exiled spirit weeps and sighs for thee! 
Heavenward the bright perfections I adore
Direct, and the sure promise cheers the way
That, whither love aspires, there shall my dwelling be.
","Clear new and beautiful light source
rich in heavenly luminaries!
House of truth, without name or veil,
of intelligences read almo rest!
Oh, how there you are, glorious body,
so far from the mortal expired longing,
almost a divine Argos taken to flight,
of our free and pious human error!
Oh beloved country! to you he sighs and cries
This, in her prison, a pilgrim soul,
carried wandering from one to another moment.
That certain beauty that makes me fall in love,
luck and seasoning grant me so much blessing,
that when love rises, the lover arrives.",,Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,renaissance
"Señor que allá en la estrellada cumbre, 
todo lo ves en un presente eterno, 
mira tu hechura en mí que al ciego infierno
la lleva su terrena pesadumbre: 
eterno sol ya la encendida lumbre 
do éste mi alegre abril florido y tierno 
muere, y ver pienso al más nevado invierno, 
más verde la raíz de su costumbre: 
en mí tu imagen mira, O Rey Divino 
con ojos de piedad, que al dulce encuentro 
del rayo celestial verás volverla, 
que a verse como en vidrio cristalino, 
la imagen mira el que se espeja dentro,
y está en su vista dél, su mirar de ella. 
","O Lord! who seest from yon starry height, 
Centered in one, the future and the past,
Fashioned in thine own image, see how fast 
The world obscures in me what once was bright 
Eternal Sun! the warmth which thou hast given
To cheer life's flowery April, fast decays; 
Yet, in the hoary winter of my days,
Forever green shall be my trust in heaven.
Celestial King! oh, let thy presence pass 
Before my spirit, and an image fair
Shall meet that look of mercy from on high 
As the reflected image in a glass
Doth meet the look of him who seeks it there,
And owes its being to the gazer's eye.
","Lord, there on the starry summit,
you see everything in an eternal present,
look at your workmanship in me than to blind hell
her earthly sorrow carries her:
eternal sun and the burning light
This is my happy, flowery and tender April
die, and see I think of the snowiest winter,
greener the root of his custom:
Look at your image in me, O Divine King
with eyes of mercy, that to the sweet encounter
of the heavenly lightning you will see it return,
that look like crystalline glass,
the image looks at what is mirrored inside,
and it is in your sight of it, your look at it.

"O del árbol más alto y más hermoso 
que produxo jamás fértil terreno, 
tierno pimpollo ya de flores lleno, 
y a par de otra cualquier planta glorioso. 
El mismo viento airado y tempestuoso 
que su tronco, tan lexos del ameno 
patrio Tajo arrancó, por prado ajeno 
te deshojó con soplo presuroso. 
Y una misma también piadosa mano 
os traspuso en el cielo, a do las flores 
d'ambos han producido eterno fruto. 
No os llore, como suele, el mundo en vano, 
mas conságreos altar, ofrezca olores 
con voz alegre y con semblante enxunto","A beauteous scion from the stateliest tree 
That e'er in fertile mead or forest grew,
With freshest bloom adorned and vigor new, 
Glorious in form, and first in dignity!
The same fell tempest, which by Heaven's decree 
Around thy parent stock resistless blew,
And far from Tejo fair its trunk o'erthrew,
In foreign clime has stripped the Ie ves from thee: 
And the same pitying hand has from the spot
Of cheerless ruin raised ye to rejoice,
Where fruit immortal decks the withered stem. 
I will not, like the vulgar, mourn your lot;
But, with pure incense and exulting voice,
Praise your high worth, and consecrate your fame.
","Or the tallest and most beautiful tree
that never produced fertile soil,
tender bud already full of flowers,
and on a par with any other glorious plant.
The same angry and stormy wind
that its trunk, so far from the pleasant
Tajo homeland started, through someone else's meadow
He stripped you of your leaves with a quick breath.
And the same pious hand
He transported you into the sky, to the flowers
Both have produced eternal fruit.
Let the world not cry for you, as it usually does, in vain,
but consecrate altar, offer odors
with a happy voice and with a united countenance",,William Herbert,renaissance
"No sabe cómo: un día se aparece en el orbe,
hecho ser; nace ciego; en la sombra revuelve 
los acerados ojos. Una mano lo envuelve. 
Llora. Lo engaña un pecho. Prende los labios. Sorbe. 
Más tarde su pupila la tiniebla deslíe 
y alcanza a ver dos ojos, una boca, una frente. 
Mira jugar los músculos de la cara a su frente 
y aunque quién es no sabe, copia, imita y sonríe. 
Da una larga corrida sobre la tierra luego. 
Instinto, sueño y alma trenza en lazos de fuego, 
los suelta a sus espaldas, a los vientos. Y canta. 
Kilómetros en alto la mirada le crece 
y ve el astro; se turba, se exalta, lo apetece: 
una Mano le corta la mano que levanta. 
","He has no notion how, but one day man appears,
A being fully made; born blind, within the dark he turns 
His waxen eyes. An arm embraces him, he learns,
He sobs. A breast deceives him. He sucks, he perseveres. 
Later, his sight will focus and dissolve the dark,
And he will see two eyes, a mouth, a brow and hair, 
The muscles of his mobile face give back his stare.
He imitates, he smiles, his lamp has found its spark, 
Dream, instinct; soul with coils of fire enfold it;
He frees them in the wind, he sings, he praises, 
Miles overhead there is a light in space:
He sees a star; aroused, inspired, he reaches up to hold it, 
And then another hand cuts off the hand he raises.
","He doesn't know how: one day he appears on the globe,
made to be; born blind; in the shadows stir
the steely eyes. A hand wraps around him.
Cry. A breast deceives him. Turn on your lips. Sip.
Later his pupil the darkness fades
and he manages to see two eyes, a mouth, a forehead.
Watch your facial muscles play on your forehead
and although he does not know who he is, he copies, imitates and smiles.
Take a long run on the dirt afterwards.
Instinct, dream and soul braid in ties of fire,
He releases them behind his back, to the winds. And sings.
Kilometers up, his gaze grows
and see the star; he is disturbed, he is exalted, he desires it:
A Hand cuts off his raised hand.

Their keels riding in the swells.

From shore to shining shore,

Rocked five rings, not one more.

verde carne, pelo verde, 
con ojos de fría plata.

The shadow upon her lies,
Green skin, and hair of green, 
Cold silver are her eyes.
Under the gypsy moon, 
Green, how I love you, green!
The world is watching her now, 
The world that she has not seen.
Green, how I love you, green! 
Great stars of frost soon gone,
And a fish-like shadow that hovers 
Opened by the road of dawn.
The fig tree scrapes at the wind 
With the sandpaper of its arms, 
The mountain, an angry bobcat, 
Bristles at those alarms!
But who will come? And from where?
 Green flesh, hair green and free,
She leans on the grated railing 
And dreams of the bitter sea.

For your house my stallion,
For your mirror my saddle, 
For your blanket my dagger.

From the mountain passes of Cahra.""

The deal would quickly be made,
But I hardly know who I am,
And my house is not mine to trade."" 
""Old man, I would like to die
With dignity in my own bed 
Of cast iron, if that could be,
With white Holland sheets outspread. 
What a wound they slashed in my chest! 
Can't you see how much it has bled?"" 
""Three hundred scarlet roses
Stain your white shirt with blood, 
It has the odor of salt,
Your sash cannot stanch its flood. 
But I hardly know who I am,
In my own house I'm not understood.""

To that lofty green balustrade, 
Let me climb, let me climb up
To the refuge green shadows have made, 
Where bannisters of scattered moonlight 
On the tumbling water are played.""

Till near the green railing they stood. 
Leaving a trail of their tears
Marked by a trail of blood. 
Little tin lanterns are trembling, 
On the tile rooftops they blow. 
A thousand crystal tambourines
Wound the dawn with lights that glow.
Green, how I love you, green! 
Green wind, Green tree and tall. 
The two men keep climbing upward. 
The long wind that lashes the wall 
Leaves an acrid taste on the lips
Of basil, of mint, and of gall.

Where has your bitter child gone? 
How many times she has waited! 
How main times waited alone!
Fresh face and jet black hair
On that green verandah till dawn!
The gypsy girl is rocking;
On the water's face she cries. 
Green flesh and hair of green 
Cold silver are her eyes.

Holds her over the pool once more 
The night becomes warm and friendly 
As a small town plaza store.

Knocking loudly against the door.

They come with the shadow fish
that opens the way of dawn.

with the sandpaper of its branches,

green flesh, green hair,
dreaming in the bitter sea.

my horse for his house,
my mount by its mirror,
my knife for his blanket.

from the ports of Cabra.
-If I could, young man,
This deal was closed.
But I'm not me anymore,
Not even my house is my house anymore.
-Compadre, I want to die
decently in my bed.
Of steel, if possible,
with the sheets from Holland.
Can't you see the wound I have
from the chest to the throat?
-Three hundred brown roses
wear your white shirt.
Your blood oozes and smells
around your girdle.
But I'm not me anymore,
Not even my house is my house anymore.

the cypresses with the birds,

letters on the canvas.

"Su luna de pergamino 
Preciosa tocando viene 
por un anfibio sendero 
de cristales y laureles. 
El silencio sin estrellas, 
huyendo del sonsonete,
cae donde el mar bate y canta 
su noche llena de peces. 
En los picos de la sierra 
los carabineros duermen 
guardando las blancas torres 
donde viven los ingleses. 
Y los gitanos del agua 
levantan por distraerse, 
glorietas de caracolas 
y ramas de pino verde. 
Su luna de pergamino
Preciosa tocando viene. 
Al verla se ha levantado 
el viento que nunca duerme. 
San Cristobalón desnudo, 
leno de lenguas celestes, 
mira a la niña tocando 
una dulce gaita ausente. 
-Niña, deja que levante 
tu vestido para verte. 
Abre en mis dedos antiguos 
la rosa azul de tu vientre. 
Preciosa tira el pandero 
y corre sin detenerse. 
El viento-hombrón la persigue 
con una espada caliente. 
Frunce su rumor el mar. 
Los olivos palidecen. 
Cantan las flautas de umbría 
y el liso gong de la nieve. 
¡Preciosa, corre, Preciosa, 
que te coge el viento verde! 
¡Preciosa, corre, Preciosa! 
¡Míralo por donde viene! 
Sátiro de estrellas bajas 
con sus lenguas relucientes. 
Preciosa, llena de miedo, 
entra en la casa que tiene,
 más arriba de los pinos, 
el cónsul de los ingleses. 
Asustados por los gritos 
tres carbineros vienen, 
sus negras capas ceñidas 
los gorros en las sienes. 
El inglés da a la gitana 
un vaso de tibia leche 
y una copa de ginebra 
que Preciosa no la bebe. 
Y mientras cuenta, llorando, 
su aventura a aquella gente, 
en las tejas de pizarra 
el viento, furioso, muerde. ","Playing her parchment moon 
Preciosa comes
along a watery path
of laurels and crystal lights. 
The starless silence, fleeing 
from her rhythmic tambourine,
falls where the sea whips and sings, 
his night filled with silvery swarms.
High atop the mountain peaks 
the sentinels are sleeping;
they guard the tall white towers 
of the English consulate.
And gypsies of the water 
for their pleasure erect 
little castles of conch shells
and arbors of greening pine.
Playing her parchment moon
Preciosa comes.
The wind sees her and rises, 
the wind that never slumbers.
Naked Saint Christopher swells,
watching the girl as he plays 
with tongues of celestial bells
on an invisible bagpipe.
Gypsy, let me lift your skirt 
and have a look at you.
Open in my ancient fingers 
the blue rose of your womb.
Preciosa throws the tambourine 
and runs away in terror.
But the virile wind pursues her 
with his breath and burning sword.
The sea darkens and roars, 
while the olive trees turn pale. 
The flutes of darkness sound, 
and a muted gong of the snow.
Preciosa, run, Preciosa!
Or the green wind will catch you! 
Preciosa, run, Preciosa!
And look how fast he comes!
A satyr of low-born stars
with their long and glistening tongues.
Preciosa, filled with fear,
now makes her way to that house 
beyond the tall green pines 
where the English consul lives.
Alarmed by her anguished cries, 
three riflemen come running, 
their black capes tightly drawn, 
and berets down over their brow.
The Englishman gives the gypsy 
a glass of tepid milk
and a shot of Holland gin 
which Preciosa does not drink.
And while she tells them, weeping, 
of her strange adventure,
the wind furiously gnashes 
against the slate roof tiles.
","His parchment moon
Beautiful playing comes
along an amphibian path
of crystals and laurels.
The silence without stars,
fleeing from the singing,
falls where the sea beats and sings
his night full of fish.
In the peaks of the mountains
the carabineros sleep
guarding the white towers
Where the English live.
And the water gypsies
they get up to be distracted,
conch arbors
and green pine branches.
His parchment moon
Beautiful playing comes.
When he saw her he got up
the wind that never sleeps.
San Cristobalón naked,
full of celestial tongues,
look at the girl playing
a sweet absent bagpipe.
-Girl, let me get up
your dress to see you.
Open in my old fingers
the blue rose of your belly.
Beautiful throws the tambourine
and runs without stopping.
The big wind chases her
with a hot sword.
The sea frowns.
The olive trees pale.
The shady flutes sing
and the smooth gong of snow.
Precious, run, Preciosa,
May the green wind catch you!
Preciosa, run, Preciosa!
Look where he's coming from!
Low Star Satyr
with their shining tongues.
Beautiful, full of fear,
enter the house he has,
 above the pines,
the consul of the English.
Frightened by the screams
three carbineros come,
their tight black cloaks
the caps on the temples.
The Englishman gives the gypsy
a glass of warm milk
and a glass of gin
Preciosa doesn't drink it.

his adventure to those people,
on slate tiles

Para ver los huecos y los vestidos, 
¡dame tu guante de luna, 
tu otro guante perdido en la hierba,

Puede el aire arrancar los caracoles 
muertos sobre la piel del elefante 
y soplar los gusanos ateridos 
de las yemas de luz o de las manzanas. 
Los rostros bogan impasibles 
bajo el diminuto griterio de las hierbas 
y en el rincón o en el pechito de la rana 
turbio de corazón y mandolina. 
En la gran plaza desierta 
mugía la bovina cabeza recién cortada 
y eran duro cristal definitivo 
las formas que buscaban el giro de la sierpe. 
Para ver que todo se ha ido, 
dame tu mudo hueco ¡amor mío! 
Donde el cielo agrupa en silencio sus cabañas abandonadas, 
Para ver que todo se ha ido. 
Aquí cantan los huecos de mañana 
con los huecos de ayer sobre mis manos 
dos sapos de ceniza, dos rumores 
de mi apariencia que mana y borbotea

conservando las huellas de las ramas de sangre 
y algún perfil de yeso, que tranquilo dibuja
instantánea sorpresa de luna apuntillaḍa. 
Mira formas concretas que buscan su vacío 
perros equivocados y manzanas mordidas. 
Cuando cuento en la cama los rumores del hilo 
has venido, amor mío, a cubrir mi tejado. 
El hueco de una hormiga puede llenar el aire, 
pero tú vas gimiendo sin norte por mis ojos. 
No, por mis ojos no, que ahora me enseñas 
cuatro ríos ceñidos en tu brazo, 
En la dura barraca donde la luna prisionera 
devora a un marinero delante de los niños.

Wind can root out snails Dead in the elephant's hide Inflate the frozen worms
From the tips of light or the apples.
Indifferent, faces drift
Under the lessened murmur of the grass And in the corner, in the frog's little breast Confusion of heart and mandolin.
In the great deserted square
The cow's head, newly severed, bawls,
And the forms that sought the trail of the snake Were crystal, fixed and rigid.
To see that all has gone,
Give me your silent emptiness, my love!
Where the sky gathers in silence its abandoned cabins, To see that all has gone.
Tomorrow's emptiness is singing here with yesterday's upon my hands
Two toads of ashes, two rumors
Of my appearance, trickling, boiling over.

What silence of trains, turned upside down! What sprouting mummified limbs!
What heaven void of outlet! O love, what heaven!

To see the emptiness of cloud and river,
Give me your laurel branches, O my love, 
To see that all has gone.
Stone in the water, voice in the wind, 
Edges of love escaping the bloody trunk. 
Enough to touch the pulse-beat of our love
For flowers to break in bloom for other children.
Pure emptiness for me revolving, for you in the dawn 
Keeping the trace of bloody branches
Some plaster profile, calmly sketching
The immediate surprise of the pointilliste moon 
Watching the solid forms that seek their void 
Mistaken dogs, half-eaten apples.
When in my bed I count the murmurs of linen
You have come, my love, to cover over my shelter. 
The hollow of an ant can fill the wind,
But you go crying lost across my eyes.
No, not across my eyes. Today you show 
Four ashen rivers in your arms,
In the rough barracks where the captive moon
Devours a sailor before the children's eyes.
To see that all has gone. 
O obstinate departed love! 
Yield not your emptiness. 
Let mine be lost on air!
To see that all has gone
","To see that everything is gone,
To see the gaps and the dresses,
give me your moon glove,
your other glove lost in the grass,

Give me your silent hole, my love!
Where the sky silently groups its abandoned cabins,
To see that everything is gone.
Here the holes of tomorrow sing
with yesterday's holes on my hands

of my appearance that flows and bubbles

What silence of trains upside down!
How much flowered mummy arm!
what a sky without an exit! love! what heaven!)

preserving the traces of the blood branches

instant surprise of luna apuntillaḍa.
Look at concrete forms that seek their emptiness
wrong dogs and bitten apples.
When I tell the rumors in bed in bed
You have come, my love, to cover my roof.
An ant's hole can fill the air,

No, not through my eyes, now you show me
four rivers girded in your arm,
In the hard barracks where the moon is imprisoned

"Señor, tú sabes cómo, con encendido brío, 
por los seres extraños mi palabra te invoca. 
Vengo ahora a pedirte por uno que era mío, 
mi vaso de frescura, el panal de mi boca, 
cal de mis huesos, dulce razón de la journada, 
gorjeo de mi oído, ceñidor de mi veste. 
Me cuido hasta de aquellos en que no puse nada. 
¡No tengas ojo torvo si te pido por éste! 
Te digo que era bueno, te digo que tenía 
el corazón entero a flor de pecho, que era 
suave de índole, franco como la luz del día, 
henchido de milagro como la primavera. 
Me replicas, severo, que es de plegaria indigno 
el que no untó de preces sus dos labios febriles, 
y se fue aquella tarde sin esperar tu signo, 
trizándose las sienes como vasos sutiles. 
Pero yo, mi Señor, te arguyo que he tocado, 
de la misma manera que el nardo de su frente, 
todo su corazón dulce y atormentado 
¡y tenía la seda del capullo naciente! 
¿Que fue cruel? Olvidas, Señor, que le quería, 
y que él sabía suya la entraña que llagaba. 
¿Que enturbió para siempre mis linfas de alegría? 
¡No importa! Tú comprendes: ¡yo le amaba, le amaba! 
Y amar (bien sabes de eso) es amargo ejercicio; 
un mantener los párpados de lágrimas mojados, 
un refrescar de besos las trenzas del cilicio 
conservando, bajo ellas, los ojos extasiados. 
El hierro que taladra tiene un gustoso frío, 
cuando abre, cual gavillas, las carnes amorosas. 
Y la cruz (Tú te acuerdas ¡oh Rey de los judíos!) 
se lleva con blandura, como un gajo de rosas. 
Aquí me estoy, Señor, con la cara caída 
sobre el polvo, parlándote un crepúsculo entero, 
o todos los crepúsculos a que alcance la vida, 
si tardas en decirme la palabra que espero. 
Fatigaré tu oído de preces y sollozos, 
lamiendo, lebrel tímido, los bordes de tu manto, 
y ni pueden huirme tus ojos amorosos 
ni esquivar tu pie el riego caliente de mi llanto. 
¡Di el perdón, dilo al fin! Va a esparcir en el viento 
la palabra el perfume de cien pomos de olores 
al vaciarse; todo agua será deslumbramiento; 
el yermo echará flor y el guijarro esplendores. 
Se mojarán los ojos oscuros de las fieras, 
y, comprendiendo, el monte que de piedra forjaste 
llorará por los párpados blancos de sus neveras: 
¡Toda la tierra tuya sabrá que perdonaste! 
","Lord, often have my words in burning tone
Beseeched your mercy for another's need,
But now I pray for one who was my own, 
My cup to drink, my honeycomb, my seed,
Marrow of my bones, sweet reason of my day, 
Song to my ears, and binding of my dress; 
Lord, since for those unknown I often pray, 
Forgive the one I loved, your wrath suppress.
I swear that he was good, his soul contrite, 
His gentle heart brought love to everything; 
By nature he was pure as summer light, 
The bearer of a miracle like the spring.
That he does not deserve my prayers, you say, 
Whose fevered lips have never sought your grace, 
Who without waiting for a sign from you one day 
Smashed in his temples like a shattered vase.
But Lord, I say to you my hands caressed 
Both the white lily of that silken brow
And the tormented heart in that dear breast;
It had the softness of an opening flower.
That he was cruel? Love was my shield and lever; 
He knew my body's depths were his to shatter; 
That he has stained my pool of joy forever?
Oh, Lord, I loved him so, it did not matter!
Here I stand now, with head and eyes bent low, 
A suppliant this long evening as I speak;
Night after night I shall continue so
If you delay the answer that I seek.
The iron that drills, a cold pleasure renews 
When it opens like sheaves that love encloses,
And the rough Cross (how well you know, King of the Jews),
Is softly borne like a garland of roses.
Forgive him, Lord, touch him with wind and light, 
Your words a thousand fragrances enfold;
Each drop of water will be dazzling, bright,
The desert will bear flowers, stones turn to gold!
The dark eyes of wild beasts with tears will flow, 
The peaks you forged of stone (Lord, save him!) 
Will weep through the white eyelids of their snow,
And the whole earth will know that you forgave him.
","Lord, you know how, with fiery vigor,
For strange beings my word invokes you.
I come now to ask you for one that was mine,
my glass of freshness, the honeycomb of my mouth,
lime of my bones, sweet reason for the day,
chirp of my ear, girdle of my garment.
I even take care of those in which I didn't put anything.
Don't have a baleful eye if I ask you for this one!
I tell you it was good, I tell you it had
the whole heart bursting from the chest, which was
soft in nature, frank as daylight,
filled with miracle like spring.
You reply, severely, that it is an unworthy prayer.
the one who did not anoint his two feverish lips with prayers,
and he left that afternoon without waiting for your sign,
shattering the temples like subtle vessels.
But I, my Lord, argue to you that I have touched,
in the same way as the spikenard on his forehead,
all his sweet and tormented heart
and it had the silk of the nascent cocoon!
What was cruel? You forget, Lord, that I loved him,
and that he knew his sore insides.
What muddied forever lymphes my joy?
It doesn't matter! You understand: I loved him, I loved him!
And loving (you know that well) is a bitter exercise;
a keep the eyelids wet with tears,
a refreshment of kisses on the braids of the hair shirt
preserving, under them, the ecstatic eyes.
The iron that drills has a pleasant cold,
when he opens, like sheaves, the loving flesh.
And the cross (You remember, oh King of the Jews!)
It is carried softly, like a bunch of roses.
Here I am, Lord, with my face fallen
on the dust, talking to you an entire twilight,
or all the twilights that life reaches,
If you take a while to tell me the word I'm waiting for.
I will tire your ears with prayers and sobs,
licking, shy greyhound, the edges of your mantle,
and not even your loving eyes can escape me
Nor do your foot avoid the hot irrigation of my tears.
Say sorry, say it finally! Will scatter in the wind
the word the perfume of a hundred knobs of smells
when emptying; all water will be dazzling;
The wasteland will bloom and the pebbles will splendor.
The dark eyes of the beasts will be wet,
and, understanding, the mountain that you forged of stone
will cry for the white eyelids of their refrigerators:
All your land will know that you have forgiven!

Your body gently as a wounded child.

Your face imprisoned underneath these stones;

"Con el mentón caído sobre la mano ruda,

carne fatal, delante del destino desnuda, 
carne que odia la muerte, y tembló de belleza.

y ahora, al otoño, anégase de verdad y tristeza. 
El ""de morir tenemos"" pasa sobre su frente,

His thought is that man's flesh belongs to the grave; 
That mortal clay must bow to fate's demand.
But hates the end of all that beauty gave. 
With love he trembled in his fiery spring,
When autumn came the cold truth drained his will: 
That we must die has brought that brow its sting, 
And grips the tortured bronze that night must fill.
His sinews writhe in a fixed agony,
And terror grips each fiber of his frame,
Rent like fall leaves by God's almighty breath
Which calls that bronze to life. There is no twisted tree 
Seared by the plain's hot sun, no wounded lion in pain 
Contorted like that man who ponders death.
","With his chin fallen on his rough hand,
The Thinker remembers that it is meat from the bone,
fatal flesh, before destiny naked,
flesh that hates death, and trembled with beauty.
And trembled with love, all its burning spring,
and now, in autumn, it is filled with truth and sadness.
The ""we have to die"" passes over his forehead,
in all sharp bronze, when the night begins.
And in anguish, their muscles split, suffering.
The grooves of his flesh are filled with terrors.
It cleaves, like the autumn leaf, to the strong Lord
that the flame in the bronzes... And there is no crooked tree
of sun on the plain, nor a lion's flank wounded,

"Amor, tú que las almas ves desnudas, 
cuéntanos el desdén i la osadía

a tus doradas flechas más agudas.

con que, después de herida, se encubría; 
si sobervia o vergüenza detenía 
lo que mostravan apariencias mudas.

cual suele Phebo al fin de su carrera, 
robando su color a cada cosa, 
las nubes adornar con arreboles. ","Thou, Love, by whom the naked soul is viewed, 
Recount to us, with what disdains and heart 
Of proof could Phyllis (with such form endued) 
Resist so long thy sharpest golden dart. 
And those close doubts, and struggling reasons show, 
With which being vanquished she her wound concealed. 
If it were Pride or Shame, which made her so 
Deny with language, what dumb shows revealed. 
What we without could see, was that her face 
Like blushing Rose put on a crimson dye; 
And her eyes hid themselves with bashful grace, 
Like languishing Apollo, drawing nigh 
His race's end; when his bright beams he shrouds, 
And, with vermilion flakes, adorns the clouds. ","Love, you who see souls naked,
tell us the disdain and the daring
with which the beautiful Philis resisted
to your sharpest golden arrows.
Tell us the reasons and the doubts
with which, after being wounded, he covered himself;
If pride or shame stopped
which showed mute appearances.

"Yo os quiero confesar, don Juan, primero:

que en vano a competir con ella aspira 
belleza ygual de rostro verdadero.

That dame Elvira's charming red and white, 
Though fair they seem, are only hers by right, 
In that her money purchased their perfection; 
But thou must grant as well, on calm reflection, 
That her sweet lie hath such a luster bright, 
As fairly puts to shame the paler light, 
And honest beauty of a true complexion! 
And yet no wonder I distracted go 
With such deceit, when 'tis within our ken 
That nature blinds us with the self-same spell; 
For that blue heaven above that charms us so, 
Is neither heaven nor blue! Sad pity then 
That so much beauty is not truth as well. ","I want to confess to you, don Juan, first:
that that white and color of Doña Elvira
It has nothing more of it, if you look closely,

But after that I want to confess to you

that in vain aspires to compete with her
equal beauty with a true face.

"¡O tú, siempre dichosa pecadora, 
la que fuiste por tal con grande espanto 
del vulgo con el dedo señalada!, 
tus lágrimas con Christo pueden tanto, 
que la menor lo enciende i enamora, 
i a la culpa mayor dexa anegada. 
Tú quedas en apóstol transformada, 
i de ignorante i mala, santa i sabia. 
No es mucho que la zarza en flor se mude 
i que el álamo sude 
en competencia de la mirra arabia, 
i que cuando de yerba al campo priva, 
la mies en abundancia se recoja. 
Venid a ver de rosas i azucenas 
las montañas estériles más llenas, 
i un árbol seco revestido de hoja. 
La planta antes inútil Dios cultiva; 
regada en su jardín con agua viva, 
es fructífera ya, i sus ramas bellas 
tocan continuamente en las estrellas. 
","Blessed, yet sinful one, and broken-hearted! 
The crowds are pointing at the thing forlorn, 
In wonder and in scorn! 
Thou weepest days of innocence departed; 
Thou weepest, and thy tears have power to move 
The Lord to pity and love. 
The greatest of thy follies is forgiven, 
Even for the least of all the tears that shine 
On that pale cheek of thine. 
Thou didst kneel down to Him who came from heaven, 
Evil and ignorant, and thou shalt rise 
Holy, and pure, and wise. 
It is not much that to the fragrant blossom 
The ragged brier should change; the bitter fir 
Distill Arabian myrrh; 
Nor that, upon the wintry desert's bosom, 
The harvest should rise plenteous, and the swain 
Bear home the abundant grain. 
But come and see the bleak and barren mountains 
Thick to their tops with roses; come and see 
Leaves on the dry, dead tree: 
The perished plant, set out by living fountains, 
Grows fruitful, and its beauteous branches rise 
For ever towards the skies.","O you, ever blessed sinner,
the one you were for such with great fear
of the vulgar with the finger pointed!,
your tears with Christo can do so much,
that the youngest turns him on and falls in love,
and the greater guilt leaves flooded.
You remain a transformed apostle,
I'm ignorant and I'm bad, I'm holy and I'm wise.
It's not long for the flowering bramble to move
and let the poplar sweat
in competition with Arabian myrrh,
And when the field is deprived of grass,
the harvest is gathered in abundance.
Come see roses and lilies
the fullest barren mountains,
i a dry tree covered in leaves.
The previously useless plant God cultivates;
watered in his garden with living water,
It is already fruitful, and its branches are beautiful
They continually play on the stars.

"El hombre fue de dos principios hecho, 
tales, que, con jactancia verdadera, 
a sus ojos le alega cualquier fiera 
i cualquier planta parentesco estrecho. 
Pero cuando él reconozió en su pecho 
la gran porción del fuego de la esfera, 
vio, con admiración de ver lo que era, 
que a la divinidad tiene derecho. 
Haz, pues, que, con trocado ministerio, 
a la vaga altivez del albedrío 
el sentido inferior la tienda redes. 
I cuando él pretendiere, o Fabio mío, 
hazerte siervo, acuérdate que puedes
mirar essas estrellas con imperio.","There are two principles in man that strive 
For ever for the mastery: he is bound 
Even to the vilest reptiles on the ground, 
And to the meanest plant or flower alive; 
Yet he has glory struggling in his breast- 
Glory that has its fountain-source above: 
He stands erect in majesty and love, 
And power, and joy, and feels that he is blest. 
Let him beware, then, that his earthly part 
Bend not his heavenly to its narrow sphere, 
Nor cloud with darkness this his mortal state; 
And, if he faint a moment, let his heart 
Find comfort in the thought—that even here 
He may the stars sublimely contemplate! ","Man was made of two principles,
such that, with true boasting,
In his eyes any beast claims
i any closely related plant.
But when he recognized in his chest
the great portion of the fire of the sphere,
He saw, with admiration to see what it was,
that he has a right to divinity.
Make then, with changed ministry,
to the vague arrogance of will
the lower sense the store networks.

make yourself a servant, remember that you can
look at those stars with empire.",,Sir John Bowring,baroque

All nature's harmony, and tower above

Brass tombs which justice hath denied his fault, 
The common pity to his virtues pays, 
Adorning an imaginary vault, 
Which from our minds time strives in vain to raze. 
Ten years the world upon him falsely smiled, 
Sheathing in fawning looks the deadly knife 
Long aimed at his head; that so beguiled 
It more securely might bereave his life;

The conscious grove thereof to have a sense 
And print it on the leaves of that tall pine.

In moving notes, and wandering through the woods 
With uncut wings, but change divert her care!

Prison, wound, war, and tyrant of my soul. 
Remain then, faithless friend, thy arts to try 
On such as court alternate joy and pain; 
For me, I dare her very eyes defy; 
I scorn the amorous snare. the pleasing chain, 
That held enthralled my cheated heart so long, 
And charmed my erring soul unconscious of its wrong.","The green spring

and in the fierce chain

bitter confusions
of the time, which has had

that my cervix tamed,
unleash disappointment with your affront,
and in the same sun I dry,
that for a time burned me,
the clothes I took out of the storm,
with a free voice essenta

I consecrate altars, and sing praises.

que tenga fin mi vida lastimosa

tendrán verde sepulcro mis cuidados, 
mis miedos y rigores 
mal merecidos, aunque bien llorados? 
¿Y cuándo el cielo santo 
impedirá la causa de mi llanto 
que quiere la fortuna 
después de verme en tan humilde estado, 
sin esperanza alguna 
de volver a gozar el bien pasado?

Ai el fiero mar se atreve 
a conquistar esta robusta peña 
con injurias de nieve, 
presumo que me avisa y que me enseña, 
que la muerte atrevida 
llama a las puertas de mi triste vida. 
Cuando el alma despierta 
con media luz introduciendo el día, 
suelo hallarme tan muerta, 
que parece verdad la fantasía 
que engendro el sueño esquivo, 
y no me puedo persuadir que vivo. 
Todo, en fin, me atormenta, 
y más el ver que con igual cuidado 
todo crece y se aumenta 
por mejorar de calidad y estado, 
y yo nunca he salido 
de una fortuna, porque mala ha sido.

sólo se vio vestido de congojas, 
en el mayo primero 
pintadas de colores ve las hojas,

escalas de cristal pone a los cielos,

Which must my life and sorrows terminate, 
That angry fortune may 
(The tyrant goddess of all human state 
Her cruelty fulfilling) 
By one kind death thus make an end of killing. 
When shall my troubled years 
Be to a verdant grave of flowers restored? 
My injuries, my fears, 
Too little merited, too much deplored? 
When shall my just complaint 
From equal heaven receive a full restraint? 
Now I am thrown thus low, 
What more can be desired by cruel Fate; 
No hope my sad thoughts know, 
Of reinjoying their past happy state: 
Oh my afflicted mind! 
Death woulds't thou come, a welcome thou shalt find. 
With patience forlorn, 
I pass the Months, the years in solitude, 
The Evening and the Morn: 
In vain my hopes thus striving to delude, 
My tears I constant keep, 
And as I am Aurora, daily weep. 
When the Rebellious Sea, 
Armed with Snow, strives to subdue this Rock, 
It seems my misery, 
At once kindly to warn, and rudely mock: 
For so the Destinies 
My life each minute offer to suprise. 
Soon as the morn appears, 
And ushers in with dubious light the day. 
My real sorrow wears 
So true a shade of death, that I betray 
My reason to that dream, 
And (though awake) dead to my self do seem. 
All things within my view, 
All things that grow and thrive by Nature's care, 
My sorrows do renew: 
For by successive change they bettered are, 
But to me fortune still 
Is therefore constant, because she first was ill. 
This Tree from January 
No livery but the hoary Frost receives, 
Yet May its dress doth vary, 
Proudly adorning it with painted leaves: 
Unto the fruitfull plain, 
What August stole, April restores again. 
This Sea sometimes enraged, 
Swells up in Chrystal mountains to the skies, 
Yet often is assuaged, 
But only I in constant miseries, 
Confined to endless grief, 
Expect no liberty, nor hope relief. ","When will the day be
let my pitiful life end
and my fortune
(of the human power tyrant god)
stop tormenting me
and did he just kill me once and for all?
When in these flowers
My cares will have a green tomb,
my fears and rigors
poorly deserved, although well mourned?
And when the holy heaven
will prevent the cause of my crying
what fortune wants
after seeing me in such a humble state,
without any hope
to enjoy the past good again?
Oh, death, if you came,
What fair feelings you will excuse me!
With a courtly soul
I spend the month and the year in solitude,
The afternoon and the morning,
and as luck would have it, my hope deceives,
crying at any time,
I always cry like I am Aurora.
Ah the fierce sea dares
to conquer this robust rock
with insults of snow,
I presume that he warns me and that he teaches me,
that daring death
knock on the doors of my sad life.
When the soul awakens
with half light introducing the day,
I usually find myself so dead,
that the fantasy seems true
that engendered the elusive dream,
and I cannot convince myself that I live.
Everything, in short, torments me,
and more to see that with equal care
everything grows and increases
to improve quality and condition,
and I have never gone out
of a fortune, because it has been bad.
The tree that in January
He only saw himself dressed in sorrow,
in the first may
painted in colors see the leaves,
and the beautiful and green field
He earns in April what he loses in August.

crystal ladders set to the heavens,
is usually calm,
and alone I with anxiety and sleeplessness
fearing the unjust fate,
I neither expect freedom, nor do I expect pleasure.",,Thomas Stanley,baroque

and be with the man who will tell me

taste the wave in your mouth,
see the abyss in his eyes.
I want to reach, if he lives,
to the old brackish and saline.
They say he only looks to the East,
-sandwich that is alive-
and I want, cutting its waves
to look at me instead of the abyss.
Everything is known at night
which is now my bed and path:
He knows hangovers, octopuses, sponges,
knows a scream that kills the sense.
It's spit out of the tide
his faithful chest and with punishment,
is whistled by seagulls
and as white as the wounded man
and immobile, and mute and absent,
He doesn't even look born anymore!
But I'm going to the lighthouse tower,
climbing the edge route
for the man who is going to tell me
the terrestrial and the divine,
and in arm and arm I carry him
jug of milk, sip of wine...
And he keeps listening to seas
who love only themselves.
But maybe I don't hear anything anymore,
of having stopped in salt and oblivion.",,Doris Dana,twentieth_cent
"Mi voluntad de ser no tiene cielo; 
sólo mira hacia abajo y sin mirada. 
¿Luz de la tarde o de la madrugada?
Mi voluntad de ser no tiene cielo. 
Ni la penumbra de un hermoso duelo 
ennoblece mi carne afortunada. 
Vida de estatua, muerte inhabitada 
sin la jardinería de un anhelo. 
Un dormir sin soñar calla y sombrea 
el prodigioso imperio de mis ojos 
reducidoa los grises de una aldea. 
Sin la ausencia presente de un pañuelo 
se van los días en pobres manojos. 
Mi voluntad de ser no tiene cielo. 
","My will to live that has no paradise
Looks downward without seeing what goes on. 
Is this the light of evening or of dawn?
My will to live that has no paradise ... 
Nor can the shadows of a noble grief
Exalt my fortune-favored flesh and breath. 
A statue's life, unpopulated death
Without desire's bold cultivation or relief.
A dreamless sleep now quiets and brings shade 
To the prodigious realm before my gaze 
Reduced to the gray village man has made.
Without a kerchief's absence and reprise 
Time passes with its cluster of drab days. 
My will to live that has no paradise ...
","My willingness to be does not have a limit;
He just looks down and without looking.
Afternoon or early morning light?
My willingness to be does not have a limit.
Not even the gloom of a beautiful duel
ennobles my fortunate flesh.
Statue life, uninhabited death
without the gardening of a longing.
A sleep without dreaming is silent and shadows
the prodigious empire of my eyes
reduced to the gray of a village.
Without the present absence of a handkerchief
The days go away in poor bundles.
My willingness to be does not have a limit.

"Esta fabulilla,
salga bien o mal,

Acercóse a olerla

If this short tale be good or ill: 
No hours in studying it were spent, 
It just occurred by accident. 
As strolling out, I sauntered o'er 
The fields that lie around my door, 
An ass across the meadow bent, 
His heedless way by accident. 
A carless shepherd boy had trod, 
But just before that very road, 
And on other thoughts intent, 
Dropt his flute by accident. 
The ass as he beheld it, goes 
To smell it with enquiring nose; 
And breathing hard, the strong breath went 
Down the flute by accident. 
The air in rushing to get free, 
Awoke the voice of harmony; 
And through the hollow channel sent 
Sweet melodies by accident. 
The shrill notes vibrate soft and clear, 
Along his longitude of ear. 
""Bravo!"" exclaims the raptured brute, 
""How masterly I play the flute!"" 
And hast thou, Reader, never known, 
Some star-blest blockhead, like friend John, 
Who following upon Folly's scent, 
Stumbled on Truth by accident? ","This fable,

it happened to me now
by chance.
Near some meadows
what's in my place,
a donkey passed by
by chance.
A flute in them
found that the boy
was left forgotten
by chance.
He came closer to smell it
the animal saying,
and gave a snort
by chance.
In the flute the air
he had to sneak in,
and the flute sounded
by chance.

how well I know how to play!

"Un Oso, con que la vida 
ganaba un Piamontés, 
la no muy bien aprendida 
danza ensayaba en dos pies. 
Queriendo hacer de persona, 
dijo a una Mona: “¿Qué tal?” 
Era perita la Mona, 
y respondióle: ""Muy mal."" 
""Yo creo,"" replicó el Oso, 
""que me haces poco favor. 
¡Pues qué! ¿Mi aire no es garboso? 
¿No hago el paso con primor?” 
Estaba el Cerdo presente, 
y dijo: “Bravo, ¡bien va! 
bailarín más excelente

Echó el Oso, 
al oir esto, 
sus cuentas allá entre sí,

hubo de exclamar así:

la Mona, llegué a dudar; 
mas ya que el Cerdo me alaba, 
muy mal debo de bailar.”

And made him dance from fair to fair, 
To please the gaping crowd; 
The rabble mob, who like the sight, 
Expressed by clamors their delight, 
And so the bear grew proud. 
Conceited now as praise he sought, 
He asked a monkey what he thought, 
And if he danced with taste. 
""Most vilely,"" honest pug replied, 
""Nay, nay, friend Monkey!"" Bruin cried, 
""I'm sure you only jest. 
""Come, come! all prejudice is wrong, 
See with what ease I move along!"" 
A Hog was by the place, 
And cried, ""According to my notions, 
There's elegance in all your motions, 
I never saw such grace!” 
Bruin, though out in his pretense, 
Was yet a bear of common sense, 
""Enough!"" he cries, grown sad. 
""The Monkey's blaming I might doubt, 
But approbation from that snout! 
I must dance very bad."" 
Thus he who gives his idle song 
To all the motley-minded throng, 
Meets many a heavy curse; 
Vexations on vexations rise, 
Bad is the censure of the wise, 
The Blockhead's praise is worse. ","A Bear, with which life
a Piedmontese won,
the not very well learned
dance rehearsed on two feet.
Wanting to play a person,
He said to a Mona: “How are you?”
Mona was an expert,
and he answered: ""Very bad.""
""I believe,"" replied the Bear,
""You are doing me little favor.
Well what! Isn't my air graceful?
Don't I take the step with care?
The Pig was present,
and said: “Bravo, well done!
most excellent dancer
""It has not been seen nor will it be seen.""
The Bear threw out,
upon hearing this,
their accounts there among themselves,
and with a modest gesture
he had to exclaim like this:
""When he disapproved of me
La Mona, I came to doubt;
but since the Pig praises me,
“I must dance very badly.”

"Ese vago clamor que rasga el viento 
es la voz funeral de una campana; 
vano remedo del postrer lamento 
de un cadáver sombrío y macilento
que en sucio polvo dormirá mañana.
Acabó su misión sobre la tierra, 
y dejó su existencia carcomida,
como una virgen al placer perdida 
cuelga el profano velo en el altar. 
Miró en el tiempo el porvenir vacío, 
vacío ya de ensueños y de gloria,
y se entregó a ese sueño sin memoria 
que nos lleva a otro mundo a despertar.
Era una flor que marchitó el estío, 
era una fuente que agotó el verano; 
ya no se siente su murmullo vano, 
ya está quemado el tallo de la flor, 
todavía su aroma se percibe,
y ese verde color de la llanura, 
ese manto de hierba y de frescura, 
hijos son del arroyo creador.
Que el poeta en su misión,
sobre la tierra que habita
es una planta maldita
con frutos de bendición
Duerme en paz en la tumba solitaria,
donde no llegue a tu cegado oído
más que la triste y funeral plegaria 
que otro poeta cantará por ti.

Esta será una ofrenda de cariño, 
más grata, sí, que la oración de un hombre, 
pura como la lágrima de un niño, 
memoria del poeta que perdí. 
Si existe un remoto cielo, 
de los poetas mansión,
y sólo le queda al suelo 
ese retrato de hielo, 
fetidez y corrupción, 
¡Digno presente, por cierto, 
se deja a la amarga vida! 
¡Abandonar un desierto 
y darle a la despedida 
la fea prenda de un muerto!

hay un recuerdo de ayer, 
una vida como aquí 
detrás de ese firmamento... 
Conságrame un pensamiento 
como el que tengo de ti. ","On the breeze I hear the knell
Of the solemn funeral bell,
Marshalling another guest
To the grave's unbroken rest.
He has done his earthly toil,
And cast off his mortal coil, 
As a maid, in beauty's bloom,
Seeks the cloister's living tomb.
When he saw the Future rise 
To his disenchanted eyes.
Void of Love's celestial light,
It was worthless in his sight;
And he hurried, without warning, 
To the night that knows no morning.
He has perished in his pride, 
Like a fountain, summer-dried; 
Like a flower of odorous breath, 
Which the tempest scattereth; 
But the rich aroma left us
Shows the sweets that have been reft us,
And the meadow, fresh and green,
What the fountain would have been.
Ah! the Poet's mystic measure
Is a rich but fatal treasure; 
Bliss to others, to the master 
Full of bitterest disaster.
Poet! sleep within the tomb, 
Where no other voice shall come 
O'er the silence to prevail,
Save a brother-poet's wail; 
That,–if parted spirits know 
Aught that passes here below,­–
Falling on thy pensive ear, 
Softly as an infant's tear,
Shall relate a sweeter story
Than the pealing trump of glory.
If beyond our mortal sight,
In some glorious realm of light,
Poets pass their happy hours, 
Far from this cold world of ours, 
O, how sweet to cast away
This frail tenement of clay, 
And in spirit soar above
To the home of endless love.
And if in that world of bliss
Thou rememberest aught of this, 
If not-Being's higher scene
Have a glimpse of what has been,
Poet! from the seats divine, 
Let thy spirit answer mine.","That vague clamor that tears the wind
It is the funeral voice of a bell;
vain imitation of the last lament
of a gloomy and haggard corpse
that in dirty dust will sleep tomorrow.
He finished his mission on earth,
and left his existence eaten away,
like a virgin to pleasure lost
hang the profane veil on the altar.
He looked in time at the empty future,
already empty of dreams and glory,
and he surrendered to that dream without memory
that takes us to another world to wake up.
It was a flower that the summer withered,
It was a fountain that exhausted the summer;
Their vain murmur is no longer felt,
the stem of the flower is already burned,
its aroma is still perceived,
and that green color of the plain,
that mantle of grass and freshness,
children are of the creative stream.
May the poet in his mission,
upon the land he inhabits
It's a cursed plant
with fruits of blessing
Sleep in peace in the lonely grave,
where it does not reach your blinded ear
more than the sad and funeral prayer
that another poet will sing for you.

This will be an offering of affection,
more pleasant, yes, than a man's prayer,
pure as a child's tear,
memory of the poet that I lost.
If there is a remote heaven,
of the poets mansion,
and only the ground remains
that ice portrait,
stench and corruption,
Worthy present, by the way,
left to bitter life!
Leave a desert
and say goodbye
the ugly garment of a dead man!
Poet: yes in non-being
There is a memory of yesterday,
a life like here
behind that firmament...

like the one I have from you.",,A. H. Everett,romantic

"Con mis coplas, Blanca Rosa, 
tal vez te cause cuidados 
por cantar 
con la voz ya temblorosa,
y los ojos ya cansados 
de llorar. 
Hoy para ti sólo hay glorias, 
y danzas y flores bellas; 
mas después, 
se alzarán tristes memorias, 
hasta de las mismas huellas 
de tus pies. 
En tus fiestas seductoras 
¿no oyes del alma en lo interno 
un rumor, 
que lúgubre a todas horas, 
nos dice que no es eterno 
nuestro amor? 
¡Cuánto a creer se resiste 
una verdad tan odiosa 
tu bondad! 
¡Y esto fuera menos triste 
si no fuera, Blanca Rosa, 
tan verdad! 
Te aseguro, como amigo, 
que es muy raro, y no te extrañe, 
amar bien. 
Siento decir lo que digo; 
pero ¿quieres que te engañe 
yo también? 
Pasa un viento arrebatado, 
viene amor, y a dos en uno 
funde Dios; 
sopla el desamor helado, 
y vuelve a hacer, importuno, 
de uno, dos. 
Que amor, de egoismo lleno, 
a su gusto se acomoda 
bien y mal; 
en él hasta herir es bueno, 
se ama o no ama, aquí está toda 
su moral. 
¡Oh! ¡qué bien cumple el amante, 
cuando aun tiene la inocencia, 
su deber! 
Y ¡cómo, más adelante, 
aviene con su consciencia 
su placer! 
¿Y es culpable el que, sediento, 
buscando va en nuevos lazos 
otro amor? 
¡Sí! culpable como el viento 
que, al pasar, hace pedazos 
una flor. 
Se ama una vez sin medida, 
y aun se vuelve a amar sin tino 
más de dos. 
¡Cuán versátil es la vida! 
¡Cuán vano es nuestro destino, 
Santo Dios! 
Siempre el destino inconstante 
nos da cual vil usurero 
su favor: 
de amor primero y no amante; 
después mucho amante, pero 
poco amor. 
Nunca es estable el deseo, 
ni he visto jamás terneza 
siempre igual. 
Y ¿a qué negarlo? No creo 
ni del bien en la fijeza, 
ni del mal. 
¡Ay! un alma inteligente, 
siempre en nuestra alma divisa 
una flor, 
que se abre infaliblemente 
al soplo de alguna brisa 
de otro amor. 
Nunca sepas, Blanca Rosa, 
que es la dicha una locura, 
cual yo sé; 
si quieres ser venturosa, 
ten mucha fe en la ventura, 
mucha fe. 
¿Y quién es el responsable 
de hacer tragar sin medida 
tanta hiel? 
¡La vida! ¡ésa es la culpable! 
La vida, sólo es la vida 
nuestra infiel. 
La vida, que desalada, 
de un vértigo del infierno 
corre en pos: 
ella corre hacia la nada; 
¿quieres ir hacia lo eterno? 
Ve hacia Dios. ","With these couplets, Rose, I'm making,
There may fill your heart the dreary
Songs I sing;
With my voice already quaking
And my eyes brimmed full of weary
Tears that sting.
Now there are for you but glories,
Dances, joys, and pretty flowers,
But someday
Nothing will remain but stories
Even of your footprint hours
Washed away.
In life's festival of madness
Listen to your heart's own pleading
Tragic breath,
That with hapless love and sadness 
Tells us that all love is leading
But to death.
How reluctantly hope reaches
And resists a creed so baneful
In your youth!
The fact were not so sad it teaches, 
If it were not, Rose, so painful
In its truth!
As a friend I warn you fairly
It is true and should not grieve you 
Love dies fast;
I regret my words said barely,
But would you have me deceive you 
As those past?
A gust of wind sweeps violent, boldly,
Love comes, God molds one fortunate
Of many a twain;
The draft of apathy blows so coldly,
And suddenly the one importunate
Makes two again.
Love with ego is redundant, 
And arranges as it rushes
Good and bad;
In love pain is food abundant,
Pride and innocence it crushes
All too glad.
Oh! How beautifully the lover
Till his continence is broken
Will comply;
But to later under cover 
Lustily his pleasure token
Satisfy.
Is he blameable who craving
Seeks for newer loves thus scattering
Love's power?
Yes, blameable as is the raving
Of the storm that passes shattering 
A flower.
Once we love with desperation, 
Even love almost as madly
Twice again.
How versatile life's dispensation! 
And our dreams that ring so sadly,
God, how vain!
Fate inconstant we discover
Like some usurer extends us
Favor's glove:
First it gives us love sans lover, 
Then the lover gives but sends us
Little love!
Never is desire quite stable,
And I've never seen affection
Twice the same. 
Why deny my tale its fable:
Neither good nor bad direction 
Fixes blame.
Stealthily the old gleam settles 
Always in us to mark faintly
Some fresh bud,
Which will open all its petals 
At the altar new love saintly
Seems to flood!
Happiness is naught but folly; 
May you never know its wavering
As do I;
Trust in chance when melancholy, 
If for destiny more favoring
You sigh.
Who, then, is the one that makes us
Swallow all this gall so hateful,
All this shame?
Life is the one! Life's pain awakes us!
Life is the faithless and ungrateful
One to blame.
Life as it rushes by so breathless
Runs toward vertigo's infernal
Fatuousness;
Seek in God for something deathless; 
Life can lead but to eternal
Nothingness...","With my couplets, Blanca Rosa,
maybe it will cause you worries
for singing
with the voice already trembling,
and already tired eyes
to cry.
Today for you there are only glories,
and dances and beautiful flowers;
more later,
sad memories will rise,
even from the same footprints
of your feet.
At your seductive parties
Don't you hear from the soul inside
a rumor,
How gloomy at all hours,
tells us that it is not eternal
our love?
How much you resist believing
such a hateful truth
your goodness!
And this would be less sad
If it weren't, Blanca Rosa,
so true!
I assure you, as a friend,
which is very strange, and don't be surprised,
love well
I'm sorry to say what I say;
but do you want me to deceive you
me too?
A strong wind passes by,
love comes, and two in one
God melts;
the icy heartbreak blows,
and he does it again, importunately,
of one, two.
What love, full of selfishness,
he adjusts to his liking
good and bad;
In him even wounding is good,
whether you love or not, here it is all
their morals.
Oh! how well the lover fulfills,
when you still have innocence,
your duty!
And how, later,
fits with your conscience
your pleasure!
And is he guilty who, thirsty,
looking for new ties
another love?
Yeah! guilty like the wind
that, as it passes, breaks into pieces
a flower.
You love once without measure,
and you still love again without success
more fingers.
How versatile life is!
How vain is our destiny,
Holy God!
Always the fickle destiny
it gives us like a vile usurer
your favor:
of love first and not lover;
then a lot of lover, but
Little Love.
Desire is never stable,
nor have I ever seen tenderness
always the same.
And why deny it? I don't think so
nor of goodness in fixity,
nor of evil.
Oh! an intelligent soul,
always in our soul motto
a flower,
that opens infallibly
to the blow of some breeze
of another love.
Never know, Blanca Rosa,
that happiness is madness,
which I know;
If you want to be lucky,
have a lot of faith in fortune,
much faith.
And who is responsible
to make people swallow without measure
so much gall?
Life! That's the culprit!
Life is just life
our unfaithful
Life, how desalinated,
of a vertigo from hell
run after:
she runs towards nothing;
Do you want to go towards the eternal?
Go towards God.",,John A. Crow,romantic
"Quiero morir cuando decline el día 
en alta mar y con la cara al cielo; 
donde parezca un sueño la agonía, 
y el alma, un ave que remonta el vuelo. 
No escuchar en los últimos instantes, 
ya con el cielo y con la mar a solas, 
más voces ni plegarias sollozantes 
que el majestuoso tumbo de las olas. 
Morir cuando la luz triste retira 
sus áureas redes de la onda verde, 
y ser como ese sol que lento expira; 
algo muy luminoso que se pierde. 
Morir, y joven: antes que destruya 
el tiempo aleve la gentil corona; 
cuando la vida dice aún: “soy tuya”, 
¡aunque sepamos bien que nos traiciona! ","I want to die young at the end of the day
On the high sea, with face to the sky,
When agony is but a dream far away
And the flight of my soul is a bird soaring by.
Let there be no sad tears as I draw my last breath, 
At one and alone with the sky and the sea,
No sobbing, nor prayer, nor laments of death; 
I only would hear the deep waves cover me.
To die when the bright glow of twilight is fading, 
And catches the waves in its last net of light;
To be like that sun as its luminous shading
Expires and is lost in the arms of the night.
To die, and die young: before time has destroyed 
The delicate fabric illusion has spun;
When life can still say: ""I am yours,"" but the void 
Of a final echo tells us death has won!","I want to die when the day declines
on the high seas and with your face to the sky;
where agony seems like a dream,
and the soul, a bird that takes flight.
Not listening in the last moments,
now with the sky and the sea alone,
no more voices or sobbing prayers
than the majestic tumble of the waves.
Dying when the sad light withdraws
its golden networks of the green wave,
and be like that sun that slowly expires;
something very bright that is lost.
Die, and young: before I destroy
time lifts the gentle crown;
when life still says: “I am yours”,
although we know well that he betrays us!",,John A. Crow,modernism
"Anoche, estando solo y ya medio dormido, 
mis sueños de otras épocas se me han aparecido. 
Los sueños de esperanzas, de glorias, de alegrías 
y de felicidades, que nunca han sido mías, 
se fueron acercando en lentas procesiones 
y de la alcoba oscura poblaron los rincones. 
Hubo un silencio grave en todo el aposento 
y en el reloj la péndola detúvose un momento. 
La fragancia indecisa de un olor olvidado 
llegó como un fantasma y me habló del pasado. 
Vi caras que la tumba desde hace tiempo esconde, 
y oí voces oídas ya no recuerdo dónde. 
¡Los sueños se acercaron y me vieron dormido; 
se fueron alejando sin hacerme rüido 
y sin pisar los hilos sedosos de la alfombra, 
se fueron deshaciendo y hundiéndose en la sombra! ","Last night when alone half-asleep I reclined
The dreams of my past were brought back to my mind.
The dreams of my hopes, of my glories and pleasures, 
Of happiness missed-all to me were lost treasures.
Now closer they came in their solemn procession 
Until the dark corners they took in possession;
A deep and grave silence reigned over the room,
And the clock's swinging pendulum stopped in the gloom.
A fragrance of faint and forgotten aroma 
Appeared like a ghost of the past in my coma.
Old faces I saw that the tomb had long hidden; 
Old voices forgotten were chatting unbidden.
The dreams approached nearer and found me asleep, 
And then slipped away to a darker retreat.
Then treading the carpet they sneaked from my sight, 
And mingling together were lost in the night.","Last night, being alone and already half asleep,
My dreams from other times have appeared to me.
The dreams of hopes, of glories, of joys
and happiness, which has never been mine,
They approached in slow processions
and of the dark bedroom they populated the corners.
There was a grave silence throughout the room.
and on the clock the pendulum stopped for a moment.
The indecisive fragrance of a forgotten smell
He came like a ghost and told me about the past.
I saw faces that the grave has long hidden,
and I heard voices heard I no longer remember where.
The dreams came closer and saw me asleep;
They walked away without making a sound to me
and without stepping on the silky threads of the carpet,
They were falling apart and sinking into the shadows!",,John A. Crow,modernism

So much that it rang in our ears,

We wept over meaningless fears,

A wonderful sweetness appears.
Some mes in the midst of an orgy 
Our sighs escape lost in the wine; 
In the bitterest water of oceans
We search for the pearls most divine.","Together we both laughed one day...
oh, and we laugh so much
that all that boisterous laughter
It soon turned into tears!

we cry a lot, so much,

"La princesa está triste... ¿Qué tendrá la princesa? 
Los suspiros se escapan de su boca de fresa, 
que ha perdido la risa, que ha perdido el color. 
La princesa está pálida en su silla de oro, 
está mudo el teclado de su clave sonoro, 
y en un vaso olvidada se desmaya una flor. 
El jardín puebla el triunfo de los pavos reales... 
Parlanchina, la dueña dice cosas banales, 
y vestido de rojo piruetea el bufón. 
La princesa no ríe, la princesa no siente; 
la princesa persigue por el cielo de Oriente 
la libélula vaga de una vaga ilusión. 
¿Piena acaso en el príncipe de Golconda o de China, 
o en el que ha detenido su carroza argentina 
para ver de sus ojos la dulzura de luz, 
o en el rey de las islas de las rosas fragantes, 
o en el que es soberano de los claros diamantes, 
o en el dueño orgulloso de los perlas de Ormuz? 
¡Ay! la pobre princesa de la boca de rosa 
quiere ser golondrina, quiere ser mariposa, 
tener alas ligeras, bajo el cielo volar; 
ir al sol por la escala luminosa de un rayo, 
saludar a los lirios con los versos de Mayo, 
o perderse en el viento sobre el trueno del mar. 
Ya no quiere el palacio, ni la rueca de plata, 
ni el halcón encantado, ni el bufón escarlata, 
ni los cisnes unánimes en el lago de azur. 
Y están tristes las flores por la flor de la corte; 
los jazmines de Oriente, los nelumbos del Norte, 
de Occidente las dalias y las rosas del Sur. 
¡Pobrecita princesa de los ojos azules! 
Está presa en sus oros, está presa en sus tules, 
en la jaula de mármol del palacio real; 
el palacio soberbio que vigilan los guardas, 
que custodian cien negros con sus cien alabardas, 
un lebrel que no duerme y un dragón colosal. 
¡Oh, quién fuera hipsipila que dejó la crisálida! 
(La princesa está triste. La princesa está pálida.) 
¡Oh visión adorada de oro, rosa y marfil! 
¡Quién volara a la tierra donde un príncipe existe 
(La princesa está pálida. La princesa está triste.) 
más brillante que el alba, más hermoso que Abril! 
Calla, calla, princesa–dice el hada madrina–; 
en caballo con alas hacia acá se encamina, 
en el cinto la espada y en la mano el azor, 
el feliz caballero que te adora sin verte, 
y que llega de lejos, vencedor de la Muerte, 
a encenderte los labios con su beso de amor. ","The princess is sad... and in languish reposes, 
She signs for relief and her lips of blown roses
Have lost their gay laughter, have lost their fresh bloom. 
The princess is pale on her throne and is waiting,
The keyboard is mute, a strange silence creating,
And the vase holds a flower that has lost its perfume.
The garden is filled with the peacocks' proud chatter, 
The duenna is banal, jejune in her chatter,
And vested in red pirouettes the buffoon;
The princess not laughing, the princess not feeling, 
Pursues in the sky where a star is concealing
An illusion as vague as the light of the moon.
Is she thinking perhaps of the prince of Galconda? 
Or of him who has halted his carriage in wonder 
To seek in her eyes for the beauty of night?
Or the king of the islands of fragrant rose bowers,
Or of him who is sovereign of diamonds and flowers, 
Or of the proud lord of the pearls of Delight?
Alas, the poor princess with lips red as cherry, 
Would now be a butterfly, swallow, or fairy, 
Have wings that would carry her far in the sky.
She would soar to the sun on a shining stepladder, 
Or the lilies of May with her verses make gladder, 
Or be lost on the wind as it lifts the waves high.
She no longer wants the gold distaff or palace, 
The magical falcon, the jester's red challis,
The swans' classic grace on the azure lagoon.
The flowers are all sad for the yearing king's daughter, 
The lotus has withered with roots in the water,
To all the four corners dead roses are strewn.
Poor princess, her eyes have a look that distresses, 
She's enmeshed in her jewels, her lavish lace dresses, 
The palace of marble encages her soul.
The superb royal palace guard never relaxes,
A hundred giant negroes with giant battle-axes 
With watchdogs and dragon would take a huge toll.
I wish that the cocoon would break its enclosure! 
The princess grows sad in her pallid composure. 
Oh, tower of ivory, oh, vision in white.
She would fly to a land where a dream prince would hail her.
(The princess is sadder, the princess grows paler) 
A prince more resplendent than dawn after night.
Be silent, my child, says the fairy godmother, 
On a swift wingèd steed never loved by another, 
With a sword at his side and a falcon above,
Rides the knight who adores you, his whole body yearning,
He overcomes distance and Death and is burning 
To impassion your lips with the kiss of his love!","The princess is sad... What will the princess have?
The sighs escape from his strawberry mouth,
that has lost its laughter, that has lost its color.
The princess is pale in her golden chair,
the keyboard of its audible key is mute,
and in a forgotten glass a flower faints.
The garden populates the triumph of peacocks...
Chatty, the owner says banal things,
and dressed in red the jester pirouettes.
The princess does not laugh, the princess does not feel;
the princess chases through the eastern sky
the dragonfly wanders from a vague illusion.
Do you perhaps think of the prince of Golconda or of China,
or where his Argentine carriage has stopped
to see the sweetness of light in his eyes,
or in the king of the islands of fragrant roses,
or in the one who is sovereign of the clear diamonds,
or the proud owner of the pearls of Hormuz?
Oh! the poor princess with the pink mouth
wants to be a swallow, wants to be a butterfly,
have light wings, fly under the sky;
go to the sun by the luminous scale of a ray,
greet the lilies with the verses of May,
or get lost in the wind over the thunder of the sea.
He no longer wants the palace, nor the silver spinning wheel,
nor the enchanted falcon, nor the scarlet jester,
nor the unanimous swans on the lake of azure.
And the flowers are sad for the court flower;
the jasmines of the East, the nelumbos of the North,
from the West the dahlias and the roses from the South.
Poor blue-eyed princess!
She is trapped in her gold, she is trapped in her tules,
in the marble cage of the royal palace;
the superb palace that the guards guard,
that guard a hundred blacks with their hundred halberds,
a greyhound that does not sleep and a colossal dragon.
Oh! Blessed is the hypsipyle which left the chrysalis!
(The princess is sad. The princess is pale.)
Oh adored vision of gold, rose and ivory!
Who will fly to the land where a prince exists
(The princess is pale. The princess is sad.)
Brighter than the dawn, more beautiful than April!
“Hush, hush, princess,” says the fairy godmother;
On a horse with wings he heads this way,
in his belt the sword and in his hand the goshawk,
the happy gentleman who adores you without seeing you,
and that comes from afar, conqueror of Death,
to light your lips with his kiss of love.",,John A. Crow,modernism

To know myself at heart
Will cost me yet again
Dark hours in the abyss
Of every How and When.

I know the secret winds

A few vague confidences

Stir fragments of consciences

And where am I going?
Knowing myself
It's already costing me
many moments of abysses

Has been a coat-of-mail pressing its wall
Against my heart. And bloody thorns let fall

¿Es una ciudad o un buque 
en el que fuésemos abandonando la tierra, 
callados y felices, 
y con tal pureza, 
que sólo nuestras almas 
en la blancura plenilunar vivieran?...

estremecimiento por la luz serena. 
Las líneas se desvanecen, 
la inmensidad cambiase en blanca piedra, 
y sólo permanece en la noche aciaga 
la certidumbre de tu ausencia.

a lunar calm of shining silk, 
the night

the white body of silence,

her hair,
in a prodigious foliage

Nothing is awake but the eye
of the clock ticking away in the gloomy tower,
burrowing uselessly into the infinite

like a carriage that never arrives.

of quietude, in whose opening 
things become dead bodies

And one shudders at how near
death is within that whiteness.
And at the beauty of the world
possessed by the ancience of the full moon.
And the powerful need to be loved
trembles in the wounded heart.
There is a city in the air,
an almost invisible city suspended,
whose vague profile
sketches on the luminous night,
like watermarks on a sheet of paper,
its multiple outlines.
A city so far away,
that it distresses with its absurd presence.
Is it a city or a ship
in which we were slowly abandoning the earth,
silent and happy,
and with such purity, 
that only our souls
could live on in the whiteness of the full moon?...
And suddenly a vague tremor
passes through the serene light.

the certainty of your absence.","Under the calm of sleep,

"Cuando el arroz retira de la tierra los 
granos de su harina, 
cuando el trigo endurece sus pequeñas caderas y levanta su rostro de mil manos, 
a la enramada donde la mujer y el hombre se enlazan acudo, 
para tocar el mar innumerable 
de lo que continúa. 
Yo no soy hermano del utensilio llevado en la marea 
como en una cuna de nácar combatido: 
no tiemblo en la comarca de los agonizantes despojos, 
no despierto en el golpe de las tinieblas asustadas 
por el ronco pecíolo de la campana repentina, 
no puedo ser, no soy el pasajero 
bajo cuyos zapatos los últimos reductos del viento palpitan 
y rígidas retornan las olas del tiempo a morir. 
Llevo en mi mano la paloma que duerme reclinada en la semilla 
y en su fermento espeso de cal y sangre 
vive Agosto, 
vive el mes extraído de su copa profunda: 
con mi mano rodeo la nueva sombra del ala que crece: 
la raíz y la pluma que mañana formarán la espesura. 
Nunca declina, ni junto al balcón de manos de hierro, 
ni en el invierno marítimo de los abandonados, ni en mi paso tardío, 
el crecimiento inmenso de la gota, ni el párpado que quiere ser abierto: 
porque para nacer he nacido, para encerrar el paso 
de cuanto se aproxima, de cuanto a mi pecho golpea como un nuevo 
corazón tembloroso. 
Vidas recostadas junto a mi traje como palomas paralelas, 
o contenidas en mi propia existencia y en mi desordenado sonido 
para volver a ser, para incautar el aire desnudo de la hoja 
y el nacimiento húmedo de la tierra en la guirnalda: hasta cuándo 
debo volver y ser, hasta cuándo el olor 
de las más enterradas flores, de las olas más trituradas. 
sobre las altas piedras, guarda en mí su patria 
para volver a ser furia y perfume? 
Hasta cuándo la mano del bosque en la lluvia 
me avecina con todas sus agujas 
para tejer los altos besos del follaje? 
Otra vez 
escucho aproximarse como el fuego en el humo, 
nacer de la ceniza terrestre, 
la luz llena de pétalos, y apartando la tierra 
en un río de espigas llega el sol a mi boca 
como una vieja lágrima enterrada que vuelve a ser semilla. 
","When rice withdraws from earth 
the grains of its flour,

as if in a cradle of aggressive pearl:
I do not tremble in the region of dying despoliation,
I do not wake to the thump of the darkness frightened 
by the raucous clapper of the sudden bell,
I can not be, I am not the passenger
beneath whose shoes throb the last redoubts of the wind 
and the rigid waves of time return to die.
I bear in my hand the dove that sleeps reclining on the seed
and in its thick ferment of lime and blood 
lives August,
lives the month extracted from its deep goblet:
with my hand I surround the new shadow of the growing wing:
the root and the feather that tomorrow will form the thicket.
It never abates, neither next to the iron-handed balcony, 
nor in the sea winter of the abandoned ones, nor in my slow step,
the immense swelling of the drop, or the eyelid that wants to be opened:
because I was born to be born, to cut off the passage
of everything that approaches, of everything that beats on my breast like a new
trembling heart.
Lives lying next to my costume like parallel doves,
or contained m my own existence and in my disordered sound
to be again, to seize the naked air of the leaf 
and the moist birth of the earth in the garland: how long
must I return and be, how long does the fragrance
of the most buried flowers, of the waves most pounded 
on the high rocks, keep in me its homeland
to be again fury and perfume?
How long does the hand of the woods in the rain
bring me close with all its needles
to weave the lofty kisses of the foliage? 
Again
I hear approach like fire in smoke,
spring up from earthly ash,
light filled with petals, and pushing earth away
in a river of flowerheads the sun reaches my mouth 
like an old buried tear that becomes seed again.

of the most buried flowers, of the most crushed waves.

"Si solamente me tocaras el corazón, 
si solamente pusieras tu boca en mi corazón, 
tu fina boca, tus dientes, 
si pusieras tu lengua como una flecha roja 
allí donde mi corazón polvoriento golpea, 
si soplaras en mi corazón, cerca del mar, llorando, 
sonaría con un ruido oscuro, con sonido de ruedas de tren con sueño, 
como aguas vacilantes, 
como el otoño en hojas, 
como sangre, 
con un ruido de llamas húmedas quemando el cielo, 
soñando como sueños o ramas o lluvias, 
o bocinas de puerto triste, 
si tú soplaras en mi corazón, cerca del mar, 
como un fantasma blanco, 
al borde de la espuma, 
en mitad del viento, 
como un fantasma desencadenado, a la orilla del mar, llorando. 
Como ausencia extendida, como campana súbita, 
el mar reparte el sonido del corazón, 
lloviendo, atardeciendo, en una costa sola: 
la noche cae sin duda, 
y su lúgubre azul de estandarte en naufragio 
se puebla de planetas de plata enronquecida. 
Y suena el corazón como un caracol agrio, 
llama, oh mar, oh lamento, oh derretido espanto 
esparcido en desgracias y olas desvencijadas: 
de lo sonoro el mar acusa 
sus sombras recostadas, sus amapolas verdes. 
Si existieras de pronto, en una costa lúgubre, 
rodeada el día muerto, 
por frente a una nueva noche, 
llena de olas, 
y soplaras en mi corazón de miedo frío, 
soplaras en la sangre sola de mi corazón, 
soplaras en su movimiento de paloma con llamas, 
sonarían sus negras sílabas de sangre, 
crecerían sus incesantes aguas rojas, 
y sonaría, sonaría a sombras, 
sonaría como la muerte, 
llamaría como un tubo lleno de viento o llanto, 
o una botella echando espanto a borbotones. 
Así es, y los relámpagos cubrirían tus trenzas 
y la lluvia entraría por tus ojos abiertos 
a preparar el llanto que sordamente encierras, 
y las alas negras del mar girarían en torno 
de tí, con grandes garras, y graznidos, y vuelos. 
Quieres ser el fantasma que sople, solitario, 
cerca del mar su estéril, triste instrumento? 
Si solamente llamaras, 
su prolongado son, su maléfico pito, 
su orden de olas heridas, 
alguien vendría acaso, 
alguien vendría, 
desde las cimas de las islas, desde el fondo rojo del mar, 
alguien vendría, alguien vendría. 
Alguien vendría, sopla con furia, 
que suene como sirena de barco roto, 
como lamento, 
como un relincho en medio de la espuma y la sangre 
como un agua feroz mordiéndose y sonando. 
En la estación marina 
su caracol de sombra circula como un grito, 
los pájaros del mar lo desestiman y huyen, 
sus listas de sonido, sus lúgubres barrotes 
se levantan a orillas del océano solo. ","If only you would touch my heart,
if only you would put your mouth on my heart, 
your delicate mouth, your teeth,
if you would put your tongue like a red arrow 
there where my dusty heart beats,
if you would blow on my heart, near the sea, weeping, 
it would sound with a dark noise, with the sound of sleepy train wheels, 
like wavering waters, like a leafy autumn,
like blood,
with a noise of moist flames burning the sky, 
dreaming like dreams or branches or rains, 
or foghorns in a dreary port,
if you would blow on my heart, near the sea, 
like a white ghost,
at the edge of the foam, i
n the midst of the wind,
like an unchained ghost, at the edge of the sea, weeping.
Like an extended absence, like a sudden bell, 
the sea spreads the sound of the heart, 
raining, at nightfall, on a lonely coast:
night doubtless falls,
and its mournful shipwrecked-banner blue 
peoples itself with planets of hoarse silver.
And the heart sounds like a sour snail, 
call, oh sea, oh lament, oh melted fright
scattered in misfortunes and rickety waves: 
from resonance the sea reveals
its recumbent shadows, its green poppies.
If you suddenly existed, on a gloomy coast, 
surrounded by the dead day,
facing a new night, filled with waves,
and if you blew on my heart cold with fear, 
you blew on its flaming dove movement,
its black bloody syllables would sound, 
its incessant red waters would swell, 
and it would sound, sound of shadows 
sound like death,        '
it would call like a tube filled with wind or weeping, 
or a bottle squirting fright in spurts.
So it is, and the lightning would cover your tresses 
and the rain would enter through your open eyes 
to prepare the weeping that you silently enclose, 
and the black wings of the sea would wheel around 
you, with great claws, and croakings, and flights.
Do you want to be the solitary ghost that near the sea 
plays upon its sad and sterile instrument?
If only you would call,
its prolonged sound, its malevolent whistle, 
its arrangement of wounded waves,
someone would perhaps come, someone would come.
from the peaks of the islands, from the red depths of the sea,
someone would come, someone would come.
Somebody would come; play furiously,
let it sound like the siren of a broken boat, 
like a lament,
like a whinny in the midst of the foam and the blood, 
like a ferocious water gnashing and echoing.
In the sea season
its snail of shadow circles like a shout, 
the sea birds belittle it and fly away,
its roll call of sounds, its mournful crosspieces, 
rise on the shore of the solitary sea.
","If only you would touch my heart,
If only you would put your mouth on my heart,
your fine mouth, your teeth,
If you put your tongue like a red arrow
there where my dusty heart knocks,

It would ring with a dark noise, with the sound of sleepy train wheels,
like wavering waters,
like autumn in leaves,
like blood,
with a noise of wet flames burning the sky,
dreaming like dreams or branches or rains,
or sad harbor horns,
If you would blow in my heart, near the sea,
like a white ghost,
on the edge of the foam,
in the middle of the wind,
like an unchained ghost, on the seashore, crying.
Like an extended absence, like a sudden bell,
the sea distributes the sound of the heart,
raining, dusk, on a lonely coast:
the night falls without a doubt,
and its gloomy blue as a shipwrecked banner
It is populated with planets of hoarse silver.
And the heart sounds like a sour snail,
flame, oh sea, oh lament, oh melted horror
scattered in misfortunes and rickety waves:
of the sound the sea accuses
its reclining shadows, its green poppies.
If you suddenly existed, on a gloomy shore,
surrounded by the dead day,
facing a new night,
full of waves,
and you will blow into my heart of cold fear,
you will blow into the lonely blood of my heart,
you will blow in its movement like a dove with flames,
its black syllables of blood would sound,
its incessant red waters would grow,
and it would sound, it would sound like shadows,
It would sound like death,
I would call like a tube full of wind or tears,
or a bottle gushing horror.
That's right, and the lightning would cover your braids
and the rain would enter through your open eyes
to prepare the tears that you deafly contain,
and the black wings of the sea would revolve around
of you, with great claws, and squawks, and flights.
Do you want to be the ghost that blows, lonely,
near the sea your sterile, sad instrument?
If you only called,
its prolonged sound, its evil whistle,
his order of wounded waves,
maybe someone would come,
someone would come,
from the tops of the islands, from the red bottom of the sea,
someone would come, someone would come.
Someone would come, blow with fury,
that sounds like a broken ship's siren,
as I regret,
like a neigh in the midst of foam and blood
like fierce water biting and sounding.
At the marine station
its snail of shadow circulates like a scream,
The birds of the sea reject him and flee,
its sound lists, its gloomy bars
They rise on the shores of the ocean alone.",,Donald D. Walsh,twentieth_cent
"Un enlutado día cae de las campanas 
como una temblorosa tela de vaga viuda, 
es un color, un sueño 
de cerezas hundidas en la tierra, 
es una cola de humo que llega sin descanso 
a cambiar el color del agua y de los besos. 
No sé si se me entiende: cuando desde lo alto 
se avecina la noche, cuando el solitario poeta 
a la ventana oye correr el corcel del otoño 
y las hojas del miedo pisoteado crujen en sus arterias, 
hay algo sobre el cielo, como lengua de buey 
espeso, algo en la duda del cielo y de la atmósfera. 
Vuelven las cosas a su sitio, 
el abogado indispensable, las manos, el aceite, 
las botellas, 
todos los indicios de la vida: las camas, sobre todo, 
están llenas de un líquido sangriento, 
la gente deposita sus confianzas en sórdidas orejas, 
los asesinos bajan escaleras, 
pero no es esto, sino el viejo galope, 
el caballo del viejo otoño que tiembla y dura. 
El caballo del viejo otoño tiene la barba roja 
y la espuma del miedo le cubre las mejillas 
y el aire que le sigue tiene forma de océano 
y perfume de vaga podredumbre enterrada. 
Todos los días baja del cielo un color ceniciento 
que las palomas deben repartir por la tierra: 
la cuerda que el olvido y las lágrimas tejen, 
el tiempo que ha dormido largos años dentro de las campanas, 
todo, 
los viejos trajes mordidos, las mujeres que ven venir la nieve, 
las amapolas negras que nadie puede contemplar sin morir, 
todo cae a las manos que levanto 
en medio de la lluvia.

all the traces of life: the beds above all 
are filled with a bloody liquid,
people deposit their confidences in sordid ears, 
assassins go down stairs,

the horse of the old autumn that trembles and endures.
The horse of the old autumn has a red beard 
and the foam of fear covers its cheeks
and the air that follows it is shaped like an ocean 
and a perfume of vague buried putrefaction.

the cord that forgetfulness and weeping weave, 
time that has slept long years within the bells,

de la virgen que fue mi catecismo. 
Y la nueva delicia, que acomoda 
sus hipnotismos de color de tango 
al figurín y al precio de la moda. 
La redondez de la Creación atrueno 
cortejando a las hembras y a las cosas

Transported here in a gold embrace
Love and Charity kiss and blend.
Don't you hear the tuning-fork of the heart?
Listen to the sound of the merry chase
Of those who were and of those who are.
My brothers of all the centuries and years
Have found in me their delayed accord,
Their harsh complaints. and their fury's tears.
I am the voice of the leaves that frisk,
The budding breast of the druid bard
With the forest as goddess and odalisque.
I am the pool where Scheherazade swims
In shining water with the ancient nudes
Like a pearl whose witness an eyeglass brims.
I am sighing Christianity sans schism
Leafing through the beatitudes
Of the Virgin who was my catechism.
And the new delight that now will ration 
The hypnotic spells that its tango sings
To the mannequin and the price of fashion.
I shout that Genesis itself is round,
And court the ladies and material things
With a very Christian and a pagan sound.
Oh, Psyche, my soul, let your music start
Today's song of forests, of orgies and art,
A song of Mary, the sound of the heart.","An intimate music does not stop,
because I passed into a golden hug
Charity kisses with Love.
Do you hear the tuning fork of the heart?
Hears the noise in its multiple notes
of those who were and those who are.
My brothers from all centuries
They recognize their pause in me the same way,
their own complaints and their own fury.
I am the talking frond in which it sways
the germinal chest of the druid bard
with the jungle as a goddess and as a beloved.
I am the luminous pool in which you swim,
like a pearl under a lens,
below the lymphs, Scherezada.
And I am the sighing Christianity
when leafing through the beatitudes
of the virgin who was my catechism.
And the new delight, which accommodates
its tango-colored hypnotisms
to the figure and the price of fashion.
The roundness of Creation thunder
courting females and things
with the pagan and Nazarene clamor.
Oh Psyche, oh my soul: it sounds like a son
modern, jungle sound, orgy sound
and the Marian sound, the sound of the heart!",,John A. Crow,modernism

Hope, beauty, song, and scents the generous rose...

Resound a thousand times when love is stirred.

beauty, dreams, generous roses...

"Mi infancia son recuerdos de un patio de Sevilla, 
y un huerto claro donde madura el limonero; 
mi juventud, veinte anos en tierra de Castilla; 
mi historia, algunos casos que recordar no quiero. 
Ni un seductor Mañara, ni un Bradomín he sido 
–ya conocéis mi torpe aliño indumentario–, 
mas recibí la flecha que me asignó Cupido, 
y amé cuanto ellas pueden tener de hospitalario. 
Hay en mis venas gotas de sangre jacobina, 
pero mi verso brota de manantial sereno; 
y, más que un hombre al uso que sabe su doctrina, 
soy, en el buen sentido de la palabra, bueno. 
Adoro la hermosura, y en la moderna estética 
corté las viejas rosas del huerto de Ronsard; 
mas no amo los afeites de la actual cosmética,
no soy un ave de esas del nuevo gay-trinar. 
Desdeño las romanzas de los tenores huecos 
y el coro de los grillos que cantan a la luna. 
A distinguir me paro las voces de los ecos, 
y escucho solamente, entre las voces, una. 
¿Soy clásico o romántico? No sé. Dejar quisiera 
mi verso, como deja el capitán su espada: 
famosa por la mano viril que la blandiera, 
no por el docto oficio del forjador preciada. 
Converso con el hombre que siempre va conmigo 
–quien habla solo espera hablar a Dios un día–; 
mi soliloquio es plática con este buen amigo 
que me enseñó el secreto de la filantropía. 
Y al cabo, nada os debo; debéisme cuanto he escrito. 
A mi trabajo acudo, con mi dinero pago 
el traje que me cubre y la mansión que habito; 
el pan que me alimenta y el lecho en donde yago. 
Y cuando llegue el día del último viaje, 
y esté al partir la nave que nunca ha de tornar, 
me encontraréis a bordo ligero de equipaje, 
casi desnudo, como los hijos de la mar. ","My childhood has its memories of a courtyard in Seville,
A garden in the sunlight where I saw the lemons fall; 
My youth, the twenty years of life spent here in old
Castile,
My history, too many things I'd rather not recall.
I have not been a Don Juan, my style was drab and gray,
–You know with what sobriety I wear these awkward
clothes–
But Cupid's arrow struck me, when it was I cannot say, 
And then I loved as many girls as summer loving knows.
The fiery blood of Jacobins is coursing in my veins, 
But what I write in poetry is from the magic spring,
And rather than be doctrinaire held fast by rigid chains, 
I want to be man of good far more than anything.
I worship beauty and despite today's aesthetic creed, 
I pluck the older roses from the garden of Ronsard,
I do not like the colors of this new cosmetic screed, 
And I am not an artist of today's vanguardist art.
I cannot stand the warblings from a tenor's shallow nose,
Nor the chorus of the crickets as they chant to moon and sun, 
I pause to separate the voices from the echoes,
And then among those voices hear but a single one. 
Am I classic or romantic? I don't know what to say,
I prefer to form my verses as a captain's sword is made
Respected by the daring hand that wields and gives it sway,
Not by the cunning artifice of him who forged its blade.
I hold converse with the fellow who always walks with me
The man who talks when all alone will someday speak with God;
My words become a warming chat about philanthropy 
With this good friend who shares with me his secret promenade.
In the end I owe you nothing, you owe me all I've said, 
I do my work and pay hard cash for everything I own, 
The suit I wear, the place I live, even my daily bread, 
And finally this narrow bed on which I lie alone.
When God's moment of truth arrives for that last rendezvous,
And my good ship is set to sail for all eternity,
I'll come aboard without delay to bid the world adieu, 
Naked and empty-handed like the children of the sea.","My childhood is memories of a patio in Seville,
and a clear orchard where the lemon tree matures;
my youth, twenty years in the land of Castile;
my story, some cases that I don't want to remember.
Neither a Mañara seducer, nor a Bradomín have I been
–You already know my clumsy clothing dressing–,
but I received the arrow that Cupid assigned me,
and I loved how hospitable they can be.
There are drops of Jacobin blood in my veins,
but my verse springs from a serene spring;
and, more than a normal man who knows his doctrine,
I am, in the good sense of the word, good.
I adore beauty, and in modern aesthetics
I cut down the old roses from Ronsard's orchard;
but I don't love the makeup of current cosmetics,
I'm not one of those new gay-warbling birds.
I disdain the romances of hollow tenors
and the chorus of crickets that sing to the moon.
I stand to distinguish the voices from the echoes,
and I only hear, among the voices, one.
Am I classic or romantic? I don't know. leave would like
my verse, how the captain leaves his sword:
famous for the virile hand that brandished it,
not by the learned craft of the precious forger.
I talk with the man who always goes with me
–Whoever speaks only hopes to speak to God one day–;
my soliloquy is a conversation with this good friend
who taught me the secret of philanthropy.
And in the end, I owe you nothing; You owe me everything I have written.
I go to work, I pay with my money
the suit that covers me and the mansion that I inhabit;
the bread that feeds me and the bed where I lie.
And when the day of the last journey arrives,
and be at the departure of the ship that will never return,
You will find me on board light of luggage,
almost naked, like the children of the sea.",,John A. Crow,gen_1898

Surges and vanishes like an old daguerreotype.

A swollen sun that blots the west with slanting rays that meet.

Move on... A star now lights the blue... It cannot be!","The street in shadow. They hide the tall mansions
the sun that dies; There are echoes of light on the balconies.

It emerges or fades away like an old daguerreotype.

los hilos del hastío y la tristeza,

el plañir de una copla soñolienta, 
quebrada por los trémolos sombríos 
de las músicas magas de mi tierra.

ponía un largo suspirar de oro,

el paso largo, torva y esquelética.

el reposar de un ataúd en tierra. 
Y era un plañido solitario el soplo 
que el polvo barre y la ceniza avienta. ","The dusk sifted into my breathless room,
Wide open to a torrid summer night,
And wrapped its hands about my desolation
As I unwound its tattered shreds of light.
Then on the air a sudden blaze of sound:
Deep sobbing of a wistful, broken strain
That quivered with the sombre tremolos
Of tragic songs from my own southern Spain.
...And it was Love, a red and fiery flame...
Whose nervous hand upon the vibrant strings 
A long and golden pause sustained
That soon flashed into stars with gilded wings–
...And it was Death, the scythe upon his shoulder,
Grim-faced and skeletal, with steps long-drawn and slow.
–Thus did I dream of him when but a child–
On the guitar, sonorous, tremulous below,
A brusque hand as it strummed would imitate
The lowering of a casket in the ground.
The breath of wind was but a solitary wail 
That winnows ash and stirs the dust around.","I meditated, absorbed, thinking
the threads of boredom and sadness,
when it reached my ear,
through the window of my room, open

broken by the shadowy tremolos

...And it was Love, like a red flame...
–Nervous hand on the vibrating rope
gave a long sigh of gold,
which became a fountain of stars.

the long, grim and skeletal step.

the rest of a coffin in the ground.

Brotaban verdes hojas 
de las hinchadas yemas del remaje, 
y flores amarillas, blancas, rojas, 
alegraban la mancha del paisaje.

del amplio río en el caudal sonoro 
se miraban los álamos gentiles.

vez que miro brotar la primavera”,

With eyes closed to the countryside around,
Spring came from nowhere, caught me in a stream 
Of golden light that smiled on flowering ground.
I saw green leaves like tiny fingers springing
From swollen branch shoots on their foliaged dress, 
And blossoms, yellow, red, and white danced bringing 
Bright colors to that landscape's wilderness.
The sun in its dirunal course projected
A shower of golden darts that swept below
Where silver poplars saw themselves reflected
Upon the stately river's soundful flow.
Through all my years of aimless wandering
Until today I never saw the spring.
Then bitterly I said in words bombastic:
""How late for happiness to come my way!"" 
But after that, poised on the wide fantastic 
Wings of another dream, still do I say 
""Perhaps I shall attain my youth some day!""","As attentive no longer to my chimera
I didn't notice around me, one day
the fertile spring surprised me
who smiled across the wide field.
Green leaves sprouted
of the swollen yolks of the remajea,
and yellow, white, red flowers,
They brightened the landscape.
And it was a rain of golden arrows
the sun on the young fronds;
of the wide river in the sound flow
the gentle poplars looked at each other.
""After so much journey, this is the first
""Every time I see spring sprouting,""
I said, and then, declamatory:
""How late for my happiness!""

wings of another illusion: ""And still
I will reach my youth one day!”",,John A. Crow,gen_1898

Peacefully sleeping.

There breaks forth, in a sunburst of memory, 
Upright on that instant
A fissure that opens on vacancy.
A cavern, perhaps?
A cavern ... But where?
A chaos is coming to be, not yet here.
It plunges, almost to drowning it plunges. But when-?
And an agony, that bolt of the morning, lights 
Oblivion's wilderness way.
While the astonished one plunges downward-and ceases to plunge-
And as I. Myself at this moment. Myself in this place. 
I awaken. I am. I exist.
Once again, O divine adaptation!
","Nothing. Spring darkness.
And in one fell swoop... What, who?
Restoration for vertigo,
abrupt restoration in that lump

sweetly asleep.
Refusing. Denied?
Through the dawning memory bursts,
vertically and suddenly,
an opening into the void.
Is it a chasm?
Sima... Where from?
That lump feels like it is, it is not there.
Almost drowning he falls, falls. When?
And an anguish, lightning at dawn,
illuminates oblivion and its desert.
The stunned man falls and stops.
I. I now. I here.
Wake up, be, be:

panic of shadows!

of darkness without voices!

Those who leave their painful nakedness upon the sands

The silver and the gold are unchanged at heart,
They skip over the scaly crest of the waves
And make music or dreams for the brightest hair.

Have already left far behind.

"Allá en el fondo del pozo donde las florecillas 
donde las lindas margaritas no vacilan
donde no hay viento o perfume de hombre 
donde jamás el mar impone su amenaza

hecho como un rumor ahogado con un puño 
Si una abeja si un ave voladora 
si ese error que no se espera nunca 
se produce 
el frío permanece

y ya el aire está libre

quedaba suspendido hecho de hierro 
Tiempo de los suspiros o de adórame 
cuando nunca las aves perdían plumas 
Tiempo de suavidad y permanencia 
Los galopes no daban sobre el pecho 
no quedaban los cascos, no eran cera 
Las lágrimas rodaban como besos

siento crecer la hierba el verde suave 
que inútilmente aguarda ser curvado

chupa de tierra un silencio o memoria ","There at the bottom of the well where the little flowers
Where the pretty daisies do not quiver
Where no wind blows and there is no scent of man
Where the sea never reaches to threaten

Born like a sound stifled in a closed harid.
If a bee, if a winging bird
If that never anticipated error
Should be made
The cold remains
The upright dream sank into the earth
And now the air is free.
Perhaps a voice, a hand now loose
An impulse toward the sky aspires to the moon,
To peace, to warmth, to that venom
Of a pillow that snuffs the breath from a mouth

Over a stiffened word already spoken

That a human back is contact, is dry cold,
Is always a dream, even if the face is rubbed away.

That sound. Do bells exist?

I remember that the lips, yes, were even speaking
It was the hot summer season. Immolating light 
It was then when the sudden flash of lightning 
Was caught in suspension–wrought of iron­–
Time of sighs or of worship me
When the birds never lost their feathers
Time of softness and permanence
The galloping feet did not tread the breast
The hooves did not remain, they were not waxen. 
Tears ran like kisses
And in the ear the echo was solidified
Thus eternity was the passing moment
Time was only a tremendous hand 
Clasping the long strands of hair
Oh, yes. In that deep silence or dampness
Beneath the seven mantles of the sky, I do not know 
The music congealed into sudden ice
The throat that collapses across the eyes
The intimate curl that disintegrates upon the lips
Asleep like a piece of cloth
I feel the little herbs growing, the soft green 
That uselessly awaits its upward curve

A heart, a forgotten plaything,
A spring, a file, a kiss, a piece of glass
A crystal flower which thus impassively 
Sucks from the earth a silence or a memory","There at the bottom of the well where the little flowers

"Había vivido mucho. 
Se apoyaba allí, viejo, en un tronco, en un gruesísimo tronco, muchas tardes cuando el sol caía. 
Yo pasaba por allí a aquellas horas y me detenía a observarle. 
Era viejo y tenía la faz arrugada, apagados, más que tristes, los ojos. 
Se apoyaba en el tronco, y el sol se le acercaba primero, le mordía suavemente los pies 
y allí se quedaba unos momentos como acurrucado. 
Después ascendía e iba sumergiéndole, anegándole, 
tirando suavemente de él, unificándole en su dulce luz. 
¡Oh el viejo vivir, el viejo quedar, cómo se desleía! 
Toda la quemazón, la historia de la tristeza, el resto de las arrugas, la miseria de la piel roída, 
¡cómo iba lentamente limándose, deshaciéndose! 
Como una roca que en el torrente devastador se va dulcemente desmoronando, 
rindiéndose a un amor sonorísimo, 
así, en aquel silencio, el viejo se iba lentamente anulando, lentamente entregando. 
Y yo veía el poderoso sol lentamente morderle con mucho amor y adormirle 
para así poco a poco tomarle, para así poquito a poco disolverle en su luz, 
como una madre que a su niño suavísimamente en su seno lo reinstalase. 
Yo pasaba y lo veía. Pero a veces no veía sino un sutílísimo resto. Apenas un lévisimo encaje del ser. 
Lo que quedaba después que el viejo amoroso, el viejo dulce, había pasado ya a ser la luz 
y despaciosísimamente era arrastrado en los rayos postreros del sol, 
como tantas otras invisibles cosas del mundo.","He had lived a long time,
He often leaned there, a very old man, on the trunk of a tree,
on a very thick trunk in the late afternoon when the sun was going down,
I used to pass by at that time and would stop to observe him.
He was old, he had a wrinkled face, and his eyes were lifeless,
rather than sad.
He would lean against the tree, and the sun would first reach him
softly biting his feet,
and it would stay there for a while as if in a huddle.
Then it would climb and slowly submerge him, immersing him,
gently tugging at him, making him one with its sweet light.
Oh, that living, enduring oldness, how it would dissolve!
All that eagerness, the story of his sadness, the traces of his wrinkles,
the misery of his eroded skin,
how it wou!d slowly be filed away in little fragments, and then vanish!
Like a rock that softly crumbles in the destructive torrent
surrendering to love's loud cry,
the old man, in that silence, was slowly being consumed, slowly giving himself.
And I saw the powerful sun slowly bite him with a great love
and lull him to sleep
so as to take him bit by bit, so as to gently dissolve him
in its light,
like a mother who tenderly lifts her child back to her breast.
I passed there and saw him. But at times I saw only a trace.
Scarcely a frail thread of being.
What remained afterwards of that loving old man,
that sweet old man, had already become pure light,
and very slowly it too was carried away by the last rays of the sun,
like so many other invisible things of this world.","He had lived a lot.
He leaned there, old man, on a log, on a very thick log, many afternoons when the sun went down.
I was passing by there at that time and stopped to observe him.
He was old and had a wrinkled face, his eyes dull, rather than sad.
He leaned on the trunk, and the sun approached him first, gently biting his feet.
and there he stayed for a few moments as if curled up.
Then it rose and submerged him, drowning him,
gently pulling him, unifying him in her sweet light.
Oh the old living, the old staying, how it faded away!
All the burning, the story of sadness, the rest of the wrinkles, the misery of the gnawed skin,
how it was slowly filing away, falling apart!
Like a rock that gently crumbles in the devastating torrent,
surrendering to a very sonorous love,
Thus, in that silence, the old man was slowly canceling himself, slowly giving in.
And I saw the powerful sun slowly bite him with a lot of love and put him to sleep.
to take him little by little, to dissolve him little by little in his light,
like a mother who gently reinstalled her child in her womb.
I passed by and saw him. But sometimes I only saw a very subtle remnant. Just the slightest fit of being.

and very slowly it was carried away in the last rays of the sun,

Te fuiste aquel minuto para toda la muerte 
a navegar en hondos océanos de silencio
con un largo camino de pupilas dormidas 
y un bando de palomas prendido a tus ensueños. 
Ya estarás por ausentes claridades de luna, 
más tuyo que en las flechas de tu reloj de oro, 
donde contabas tanto minuto sin orillas 
para la sed de alas que quemaba tus hombros. 
Y habrás saltado mares que la inquietud miraba, 
abismos en la tímida soledad de tu ausencia; 
y en la noche habrás sido tenue brisa caliente 
junto a aquel pedacito de tu amorosa tierra. 
Largo abrazo de alientos sobre las amapolas 
y una risa, y un canto sin palabras ni música; 
y un aquí estoy gozoso de pasados insomnios, 
y un para siempre cálido en la fría llanura. 
Como partiste en brazos del silencio apretado, 
resonará más viva la luz de tus palabras; 
y en cada estrofa de aire se enredará un acento, 
y en cada mariposa te nacerán más alas. 
Gozo de estar ya vivo para el eterno día, 
de saberte en el agua, y en el sol, y en la hierba. 
Harás entre las nubes Nacimientos de plata 
y encontrarás tu nido en un árbol de estrellas. ","Peace, peace, he is not dead, he doth not sleep. 
He hath awakened from the dream of life.

Shelley

You went away that moment for all death
To travel on deep seas where silence seems
A long highway of eyes that are asleep
A flock of doves all fastened to your dreams.
You live now in the beams of absent moonlight
More your own self than in time's golden hands and springs
On which so many borderless moments recorded
The thirst that burned your shoulders' budding wings.
You will have moved beyond the seas' wild reckoning,
Abysses in your timid solitude now lost;
At night you will become a tenuous warm breeze 
Beside that loving mound that holds your ghost.
Long held embrace of breaths over red poppies,
Laughter and wordless song, sans music, sans refrain, 
A joyful ""here I am"" of many sleepless hours,
A warm ""forever"" on the cold and distant plain.
And since you went pressed in the arms of silence, 
Your words of light will now more clearly sound, 
Wings will be born for you in each butterfly,
And for each verse of air an accent will be found.
I live in joy for that eternal day
To find you in the water, grass, and sky, 
Among the clouds you make crêches of silver, 
And in a tree of stars your nest will lie.","Peace, peace, he is not dead, he does not sleep.
He has awakened from the dream of life.

Shelley

You left that minute for all death
to navigate deep oceans of silence
with a long path of sleeping pupils
and a flock of doves attached to your dreams.
You will already be absent moonlight,
more yours than in the arrows of your gold watch,
where you counted so many minutes without shores
for the thirst for wings that burned your shoulders.
And you will have jumped seas that restlessness watched,
abysses in the timid solitude of your absence;
and in the night you will have been a faint hot breeze
next to that little piece of your loving land.
Long embrace of breath on the poppies
and a laugh, and a song without words or music;
and here I am rejoicing from past insomnia,
and a warm forever on the cold plain.
As you left in the arms of the tight silence,
The light of your words will resonate more vividly;
and in each stanza of air an accent will be entangled,
and in each butterfly you will grow more wings.
Joy of being alive for the eternal day,
to know you in the water, and in the sun, and in the grass.
You will make silver births among the clouds
and you will find your nest in a tree of stars.",,John A. Crow,twentieth_cent

de sus innumerables tumbas. 
Como si ayer llegara con su recuerdo escrito 
mañana estuviera ya en su cárcel de letras; 
como si hoy fuera una enorme rosa 
de millones de pétalos unidos 
en una sola esquina del mundo revelado. 
O aún mejor: como si todo beso 
de amante hubiera roto su semilla 
y se alzaran al viento del crepúsculo 
sus alas libres. 
Como el vuelo 
apretado de ejércitos de ángeles 
en su más alto círculo. 
Como ascensión de un pensamiento libre 
hasta el principio 
donde nació la luz y se formaron 
entraña de dolor, gérmen de grito 
y lágrima primera bajo el cielo. 
Como si todo junto de repente 
se pusiera entre el hombre y su destino. 
Como si ante el ocaso rojo abriera 
un girasol sus rayos amarillos. 
Como si aquella mano 
de ayer regara azules lirios 
y fuera el mar bajo la mano 
un palomar de pétalos heridos. 
Y como si los barcos emergieran 
de su muerte de hierros, de su sueño 
de peces, de su olvido, 
para tender sus velas inmortales 
a los vientos y al sol. 
Como si fríos 
los huesos de la tierra, 
por fuego inmaterial enrojecidos 
hasta el blanco del alma 
volvieran a pesar, a estremecerse, 
a reír y a llorar, en risa y llanto 
de verdad, en latidos 
de pecho verdadero, en ojos limpios, 
en bocas sin pecado, en tibia 
caricia de sus carnes. 
Así dicho 
frente al ocaso, desde la tierra al mar, 
con la ternura junto a mí. 
Se alegra 
el corazón de manso gris vestido. ","Between me and the sunset, the whole of life. 
As if time, arrested
Were falling 
To blossom in a drop of water.
As if God in his lofty meditation
were drying the tears of his sons;
And She, the colorless one, were sleeping on the flowering border
Of her innumerable tombs.
As if yesterday were to come with its written memory
And tomorrow were already in its prison of letters;
As if today were an enormous rose
Of millions of petals, united
In a single comer of the revealed world.
Or better still; as if all lovers' kisses
Had burst from their seedbed
And were raising in the twilight wind
Their liberated wings.
Like the compact flight
Of armies of angels
In their highest sphere.
Like the ascension of a thought at liberty 
Toward the source
Where light is born and the core of sorrow,
The germ of a cry and a first tear
Have taken form under the sky.
As if all this together suddenly
Intervened between man and his destiny.
As if a sunflower were opening its yellow petals
In front of the red west.
As if the hand of yesterday
Were sprinkling blue lilies
And the sea beneath the hand
Were a dovecote of wounded petals.
And as if ships were emerging
From their dead iron, from their dream of fishes,
From their oblivion
To stretch their immortal sails 
In the winds and the sun.
As if the cold
Bones of the earth
Reddened by immaterial fire,
Were returning to the white heat of the soul
To ponder, to tremble
To laugh, and to weep, with laughter and tears
Of truth, in the beating
Of an actual breast, in clean eyes,
In sinless mouths, in the warm
Caress of its flesh.
These words,
Facing the west, from sea to sky,
With tenderness close to me.
The heart,
Dressed in gray humility, rejoices.","Between the sunset and me, all my life.
As if stopped
time will fall
to bloom in a drop of water.
As if God is your high thought
dry the tears of his children;
and She, the colorless one, would sleep at the flowering edge
of its innumerable tombs.
As if yesterday arrived with its memory written
Tomorrow he would be in his prison of letters;
as if today were a huge rose
of millions of petals united
in a single corner of the revealed world.
Or even better: as if everything kisses
as a lover I would have broken his seed
and they will rise to the twilight wind
his wings free.
like the flight
tight of armies of angels
in its highest circle.
As the ascension of a free thought
until the beginning
where the light was born and were formed
entrails of pain, germ of scream
and first tear under heaven.
As if everything suddenly came together
was placed between man and his destiny.
As if before the red sunset it opened
a sunflower its yellow rays.
As if that hand
Yesterday I watered blue lilies
and out was the sea under the hand
a dovecote of wounded petals.
And as if the ships emerged
of his iron death, of his dream
of fish, of their oblivion,
to spread their immortal candles
to the winds and the sun.
As if cold
the bones of the earth,
by immaterial fire reddened
to the white of the soul
they returned to regret, to shudder,
to laugh and cry, in laughter and crying
really, in beats
with true chest, in clean eyes,
in mouths without sin, in lukewarm
caress of their meat.
So said
facing the sunset, from land to sea,
with tenderness next to me.
Rejoices
the heart of meek gray dress.",,H. R. Hays,twentieth_cent
"La muerte, toda llena de agujeros 
y cuernos de su mismo desenlace, 
bajo una piel de toro pisa y pace 
un luminoso prado de toreros. 
Volcánicos bramidos, humos fieros 
de general amor por cuanto nace, 
a llamaradas echa mientras hace 
morir a los tranquilos ganaderos. 
Ya puedes, amorosa fiera hambrienta, 
pastar mi corazón, trágica grama, 
si te gusta lo amargo de su asunto. 
Un amor hacia todo me atormenta 
como a ti, y hacia todo se derrama 
mi corazón vestido de difunto. ","Death, all riddled with holes 
And gorings from your very self,
In the hide of a bull you walk and graze 
On a bullfighter's shining meadow.
He gives volcanic roars in sudden flashes, 
And then streams with the fierce smoke 
Of a love for everything that is born
As he kills the quiet rancheros.
Wild, hungry, loving beast, you can 
Feed on my heart, on tragic grass,
If you like its bitter flavor.
A love for everything torments me now 
As it does you, and towards it all
My heart spills out dressed in its burial clothes.","Death, all full of holes
and horns of its own outcome,
under a bull's skin he steps and grazes
a bright bullfighter's meadow.
Volcanic roars, fierce smoke

he throws flames while he does
die to the quiet ranchers.

graze my heart, tragic grass,

like you, and towards everything it spills
my heart dressed as the deceased.",,John A. Crow,twentieth_cent
"El amor ascendía entre nosotros 
como la luna entre las dos palmeras 
que nunca se abrazaron. 
El íntimo rumor de los dos cuerpos 
hacia el arrullo un oleaje trajo, 
pero la ronca voz fue atenazada. 
Fueron pétreos los labios. 
El ansia de ceñir movió la carne, 
esclareció los huesos inflamados, 
pero los brazos al querer tenderse 
murieron en los brazos. 
Pasó el amor, la luna, entre nosotros 
y devoró los cuerpos solitarios, 
y somos dos fantasmas que se buscan 
y se encuentran lejanos. ","Love rose between us like the moon
Between the two tall palms
That never kissed.
The intimate sound of our two bodies 
Was like a secret lullaby,
But the hoarse voice was tortured. 
The lips were cold as stone.
Flesh longed for flesh in a warm clasp. 
It set a flame within the kindled bones, 
But when the arms reached out
They died on other arms.
Love passed between us like the moon 
And devoured our lonely bodies.
Now we are two ghosts who seek each other 
But always with a distance between us.","Love rose between us
like the moon between the two palm trees
who never hugged each other.
The intimate rumor of the two bodies
towards the lullaby a wave brought,
but the hoarse voice was restrained.
The lips were stony.
The desire to gird moved the flesh,
cleared up the inflamed bones,
but the arms when they want to reach out
They died in the arms.
Love passed, the moon, between us
and devoured the lonely bodies,
and we are two ghosts looking for each other
and they are far away.",,John A. Crow,twentieth_cent
"La mirada interior se despliega y un mundo de vértigo y llama nace bajo la frente del que sueña: 
soles azules, verdes remolinos, picos de luz que abren astros como granadas, 
tornasol solitario, ojo de oro girando en el centro de una explanada calcinada, 
bosques de cristal de sonido, bosques de ecos y respuestas y ondas, diálogo de transparencias, 
¡viento, galope de agua entre los muros interminables de una garganta de azabache, 
caballo, cometa, cohete que se clava justo en el corazón de la noche, plumas. surtidores, 
plumas, súbito florecer de las antorchas, velas, alas, invasión de lo blanco, 
pájaros de las islas cantando bajo la frente del que sueña! 
Abrí los ojos, los alcé hasta el cielo y vi cómo la noche se cubría de estrellas. 
¡Islas vivas, brazaletes de islas llameantes, piedras ardiendo, respirando, racimos de piedras vivas. 
cuánta fuente, qué claridades, qué cabelleras sobre una espalda oscura, 
cuanto río allá arriba, y ese sonar remoto del agua junto al fuego, de luz contra la sombra! 
Harpas, jardines de harpas. 
Pero a mi lado no había nadie. 
Sólo el llano: cactus, huizaches, piedras enormes que estallan bajo el sol. 
No cantaba el grillo, 
había un vago olor a cal y semillas quemadas, 
las calles del poblado eran arroyos secos 
y el aire se habría roto en mil pedazos si alguien hubiese gritado: ¿quién vive? 
Cerros pelados, volcán frío, piedra y jadeo bajo tanto esplendor, sequía, sabor de polvo, 
rumor de pies descalzos sobre el polvo, ¡y el pirú en medio del llano como un surtidor petrificado! 
Dime, sequía, dime. tierra quemada, tierra de huesos remolidos, dime, luna agónica, 
¿no hay agua, 
hay sólo sangre, sólo hay polvo, sólo pisadas de pies desnudos sobre la espina, 
sólo andrajos y comida de insectos y sopor bajo el mediodía impío como un cacique de oro? 
¿No hay relinchos de caballos a la orilla del río, entre las grandes piedras redondas y relucientes, 
en el remanso, bajo la luz verde de las hojas y los gritos de los hombres y las mujeres bañándose al alba? 
El dios-maíz, el dios-flor, el dios-agua, el dios-sangre, la Virgen, 
¿todos se han muerto, se han ido, cántaros rotos al borde de la fuente cegada? 
¿Sólo está vivo el sapo, 
sólo reluce y brilla en la noche de México el sapo verduzco,
sólo el cacique gordo de Cempoala es inmortal? 
Tendido al pie del divino árbol de jade regado con sangre, mientras dos esclavos jóvenes lo abanican, 
en los días de las grandes procesiones al frente del pueblo apoyado en la cruz: arma y bastón, 
en traje de batalla, el esculpido rostro de sílex aspirando como un incienso precioso el humo de los fusilamientos, 
los fines de semana en su casa blindada junto al mar, al lado de su querida cubierta de joyas de gas neón, 
¿sólo el sapo es inmortal? 
He aquí a la rabia verde y fría y a su cola de navajas y vidrio cortado, 
he aquí al perro y a su aullido sarnoso, 
al maguey taciturno, al nopal y al candelabro erizados, he aquí a la flor que sangra y hace sangrar, 
la flor de inexorable y tajante geometría como un delicado instrumento de tortura,  
he aquí a la noche de dientes largos y mirada filosa, la noche que desuella con un pedernal invisible, 
oye a los dientes chocar uno contra otro, 
oye a los huesos machacando a los huesos, 
al tambor de piel humana golpeado por el fémur, 
al tambor del pecho golpeado por el talón rabioso, 
al tam-tam de los tímpanos golpeados por el sol delirante, 
he aquí al polvo que se levanta como un rey amarillo y todo lo descuaja y danza solitario y se derrumba 
como un árbol al que de pronto se le han secado las raíces, como una torre que cae de un solo tajo, 
he aquí al hombre que cae y se levanta y come polvo y se arrastra, 
al insecto humano que perfora la piedra y perfora los siglos y carcome la luz, 
he aquí a la piedra rota, al hombre roto, a luz luz rota. 
¿Abrir los ojos o cerrarlos, todo es igual? 
Castillos interiores que incendia el pensamiento porque otro más puro se levante, sólo fulgor y llama, 
semilla de la imagen que crece hasta ser árbol y hace estallar el cráneo, 
palabra que busca unos labios que la digan, 
sobre la antigua fuente humana cayeron grandes piedras, 
hay siglos de piedras, años de losas, minutos espesores sobre la fuente humana. 
Dime, sequía, piedra pulida por el tiempo sin dientes, por el hambre sin dientes, 
polvo molido por dientes que son siglos, por siglos que son hambres, 
dime, cántaro roto caído en el polvo, dime, 
¿la luz nace frotando hueso contra hueso, hombre contra hombre, hambre contra hambre, 
hasta que surja al fin la chispa, el grio, la palabra, 
hasta que brote al fin el agua y crezca el árbol de anchas hojas de turquesa? 
Hay que dormir con los ojos abiertos, hay que soñar con las manos, 
soñemos sueños activos de río buscando su cauce, sueños de sol soñando sus mundos, 
hay que soñar en voz alta, hay que cantar hasta el que canto eche raíces, tronco, ramas, pájaros, astros, 
cantar hasta que el sueño engendre y brote del costado del dormido la espiga roja de la resurrección, 
el agua de la mujer, el manantial para beber y mirarse y reconocerse y recobrarse,
el manantial para saberse hombre, el agua que habla a solas en la noche y nos llama con nuestro nombre, 
el manantial de las palabras para decir yo, tú, él, nosotros, bajo el gran árbol viviente estatua de la lluvia, 
para decir los pronombres hermosos y reconocernos y ser fieles a nuestros nombres 
hay que soñar hacia atrás, hacia la fuente, hay que remar siglos arriba, 
más allá de la infancia, más allá del comienzo, más allá de las aguas del bautismo, 
echar abajo las paredes entre el hombre y el hombre, juntar de nuevo lo que fue separado, 
vida y muerte no son mundos contrarios, somos un solo tallo con dos flores gemelas, 
hay que desenterrar la palabra perdida, soñar hacia dentro y también hacia afuera, 
descifrar el tatuaje de la noche y mirar cara a cara al mediodía y arrancarle su máscara, 
bañarse en luz solar y comer los frutos nocturnos, deletrear la escritura del astro y la del río, 
recordar lo que dicen la sangre y la marea, la tierra y el cuerpo, volver al punto de partida, 
ni adentro ni afuera, ni arriba ni abajo, al cruce de caminos, adonde empiezan los caminos, 
porque la luz canta con un rumor de agua, con un rumor de follaje canta el agua 
y el alba está cargada de frutos, el día y la noche reconciliados fluyen como un río manso, 
el día y la noche se acarician largamente como un hombre y una mujer enamorados, 
como un solo río interminable bajo arcos de siglos fluyen las estaciones y los hombres, 
hacia, allá, al centro vivo del origen, más allá de fin y comienzo. 
","The inward look unfolds and a world of vertigo and flame is born in the dreamer's brow:
blue suns, green whirlwinds, birdbeaks of light pecking open the pomegranate stars,
and the solitary sunflower, a gold eye revolving at the center of a burnt slope,
and forests of ringing crystal, forests of echoes and answers and waves, a dialogue of transparencies
and the wind, and the gallop of water between the interminable walls of a jet throat,
and the horse, the comet, the skyrocket piercing the night's heart, and feathers and fountains,
feathers, a sudden blossoming of torches, candles, wings, an invasion of whiteness,
birds of the islands singing in the dreamer's brow!
I opened my eyes, looked up at the sky, and saw how the night was covered with stars:
living islands, bracelets of flaming islands, burning and breathing stones, clusters of living stones,
and all those fountains and clear lights, those long locks against a dark shoulder,
and so many rivers, and the far-off sound of water next to fire, of light against shadow!
Harps, gardens of harps.
But I was alone in the field:
it was cactus, and thorns, and great rocks cracking in the sun.
The crickets were silent.
There was a stray odor of lime and burnt seeds,
the village streets were dry gullies,
and the air would have shattered into a thousand pieces if someone had shouted: Who goes there?
Bare hills, a cold volcano, stone and a sound of panting under such splendor, and drouth, the taste of dust,
the rustle of bare feet in the dust, and one tall tree in the middle of the field like a petrified fountain!
Tell me, drouth, tell me, burnt earth, earth of ground bones, tell me, agonized moon:
is there no water,
is there only blood, only dust, only naked footsteps on the thorns,
only rags and food for insects and stupor under the impious noon, that golden chief?
Are there no horses neighing at the riverbank among the great smooth glistening boulders,
in the still water, under the green light of the leaves and the shouts of the men and women bathing at dawn?
Where are the gods, the corn-god, the flower-god, the water-god, the blood-god, the Virgin,
have they all died, have they all departed, broken waterjars at the edge of the blocked fount?
Is only the toad alive?
Does only the gray-green toad glow and shine in the Mexican night?
Is only the fat chief of Cempoala immortal?
Is only the toad alive,
reclining under the divine tree of jade which is watered with blood, while two young slaves fan him,
leading the great public processions, leaning on the cross: weapon and walkingstick,
in battle dress, in a carved stone mask, breathing the smoke of the firing squads like a precious incense,
or spending long weekends in his fortified house at the sea-shore with his mistress and her neon jewels?
Look at the cold green rage with its tail of knives and cut glass,
look at the dog with the mangy howl,
the taciturn maguey, the bristling cactus, the flower that bleeds and lets blood, the flower whose sharp inexorable geometry is like a delicate instrument of torture,
look at the night with its long teeth and slashing eyes, the night that flays with an invisible stone,
listen to the teeth colliding,
listen to the bones crushing bones,
the thighbone pounding the drum of human skin,
the furious heel pounding the drum of the breast,
the delirious sun pounding the tom-tom of the eardrums,
look at the dust that rises like a yellow king and uproots everything and dances alone and falls down
like a tree whose roots have suddenly dried up, like a tower collapsing at the first blow,
look at the man who falls and rises and eats dust and crawls along,
the human insect who pierces the rock and pierces the centuries and gnashes at the light,
look at the broken rock, the broken man, the broken light.
Is it all the same if we open our eyes or close them?
Thought burns down our interior castle so that another may rise in their place, all flame and refulgence,
the seed of an image growing up into a tree that cracks the skull,
the word seeking lips that will speak it.
Great stones have cumbered the ancient human fount,
there are centuries of stones, years of flagstones, ponderous stone minutes heaped over the human fount.
Tell me, drouth, stone polished smooth by toothless time, by toothless hunger,
dust ground to dust by teeth that are centuries, by centuries that are hunger,
tell me, broken waterjar in the dust, tell me,
is the light born to rub bone against bone, man against man, hunger against hunger,
till the spark, the cry, the word spurts forth at last,
till the water flows and the tree with wide turquoise leaves arises at last?
We must sleep with open eyes, we must dream with our hands,
we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course, of the sun dreaming its worlds,
we must dream aloud, we must sing till the song puts forth roots, trunk, branches, birds, stars,
we must sing till the dream engenders in the sleeper's flank the red wheat-ear of resurrection,
the womanly water, the spring at which we may drink and recognize ourselves and recover,
the spring that tells us we are men, the water that speaks alone in the night and calls us by name,
the spring of words that say I, you, he, we, under the great tree, the living statue of the rain,
where we pronounce the beautiful pronouns, knowing ourselves and keeping faith with our names,
we must dream backwards, toward the source, we must row back up the centuries,
beyond infancy, beyond the beginning, beyond the waters of baptism, 
we must break down the walls between man and man, reunite what has been sundered,
life and death are not opposite worlds, we are one stem with twin flowers,
we must find the lost word, dream inwardly and also outwardly,
decipher the night's tattooing and look face to face at the noonday and tear off its mask,
bathe in the light of the sun and eat the night's fruit and spell out the writings of stars and rivers,
and remember what the blood, the tides, the earth, and the body say, and return to the point of departure,
neither inside nor outside, neither up nor down, at the cross-roads where all roads begin,
for the light is singing with a sound of water, the water with a sound of leaves,
the dawn is heavy with fruit, the day and the night flow together in reconciliation like a calm river,
the day and the night caress each other like a man and woman in love,
and the seasons and all mankind are flowing under the arches of the centuries like one endless river
toward the living center of origin, beyond the end and the beginning.","The inner gaze unfolds and a world of vertigo and flame is born under the forehead of the dreamer:
blue suns, green swirls, peaks of light that open stars like pomegranates,
solitary litmus sun, golden eye spinning in the center of a charred esplanade,
crystal forests of sound, forests of echoes and responses and waves, dialogue of transparencies,
wind, gallop of water between the endless walls of a jet gorge,
horse, comet, rocket that sticks right in the heart of the night, feathers. suppliers,
feathers, sudden blooming of torches, candles, wings, invasion of white,
Birds of the islands singing under the forehead of the one who dreams!
I opened my eyes, raised them to the sky and saw how the night was covered with stars.
Living islands, bracelets of flaming islands, burning, breathing stones, clusters of living stones.
how much fountain, what clarities, what hair on a dark back,
How much river up there, and that remote sound of water next to fire, of light against shadow!
Harps, gardens of harps.
But there was no one next to me.
Only the plain: cacti, huizaches, huge stones that explode under the sun.
The cricket did not sing,
There was a vague smell of lime and burnt seeds,
the streets of the town were dry streams
and the air would have broken into a thousand pieces if someone had shouted: who lives?
Bare hills, cold volcano, stone and gasping under so much splendor, drought, taste of dust,
sound of bare feet on the dust, and the piru in the middle of the plain like a petrified fountain!
Tell me, drought, tell me. scorched earth, land of crushed bones, tell me, agonizing moon,
there's no water,
There is only blood, there is only dust, only footprints of bare feet on the thorn,
only rags and insect food and torpor under the impious noon like a golden chieftain?
Aren't there horses neighing on the river bank, among the big round shiny stones,
in the backwater, under the green light of the leaves and the screams of men and women bathing at dawn?
The corn-god, the flower-god, the water-god, the blood-god, the Virgin,
Have they all died, are they gone, broken jugs on the edge of the blocked fountain?
Is only the toad alive,
Only the green toad shines and shines in the night of Mexico,
only the fat chief of Cempoala is immortal?
Lying at the foot of the divine jade tree watered with blood, while two young slaves fan him,
on the days of the great processions in front of the people leaning on the cross: weapon and staff,
in battle dress, his sculpted flint face inhaling the smoke of the executions like precious incense,
on weekends in his armored house by the sea, next to his beloved neon jewelry cover,
Is only the toad immortal?
Behold the cold green rage and its tail of razors and cut glass,
behold the dog and his mangy howl,
to the taciturn maguey, to the prickly pear and to the bristling candelabra, here is the flower that bleeds and makes people bleed,
the flower of inexorable and blunt geometry like a delicate instrument of torture,
behold the night of long teeth and sharp gaze, the night that flays with an invisible flint,
Hear the teeth clash against each other,
Hear the bones crushing the bones,
to the human skin drum struck by the femur,
to the drum of the chest beaten by the angry heel,
to the tom-tom of the eardrums beaten by the delirious sun,
behold the dust that rises like a yellow king and dislodges everything and dances alone and collapses
like a tree whose roots have suddenly withered, like a tower that falls with a single cut,
behold the man who falls and rises and eats dust and crawls,
to the human insect that pierces the stone and pierces the centuries and eats away the light,
behold the broken stone, the broken man, the broken light.
Opening your eyes or closing them, is everything the same?
Interior castles that set fire to the thought because another purer one rises, only brilliance and flame,
seed of the image that grows into a tree and explodes the skull,
word that seeks lips to say it,
large stones fell on the ancient human fountain,
There are centuries of stones, years of slabs, minutes of thickness above the human source.
Tell me, drought, stone polished by time without teeth, by hunger without teeth,
dust ground by teeth that are centuries, by centuries that are famines,
Tell me, broken jug fallen in the dust, tell me,
Is light born by rubbing bone against bone, man against man, hunger against hunger,
until the spark, the cry, the word finally emerges,
until the water finally flows and the tree with wide turquoise leaves grows?
You have to sleep with your eyes open, you have to dream with your hands,
Let us dream active dreams of the river searching for its channel, dreams of the sun dreaming of its worlds,
You have to dream out loud, you have to sing until the one I sing takes root, trunk, branches, birds, stars,
sing until sleep begets and the red spike of resurrection sprouts from the side of the sleeping one,
the water of the woman, the spring to drink and look at each other and recognize each other and recover,
the spring to know oneself as a man, the water that speaks alone in the night and calls us with our name,
the spring of words to say I, you, him, us, under the great living tree statue of the rain,
to say the beautiful pronouns and recognize each other and be true to our names
You have to dream backwards, towards the source, you have to row centuries up,
beyond infancy, beyond the beginning, beyond the waters of baptism,
break down the walls between man and man, put together again what was separated,
Life and death are not opposite worlds, we are a single stem with two twin flowers,
you have to unearth the lost word, dream inwards and also outwards,
decipher the tattoo of the night and look face to face at noon and tear off its mask,
bathe in sunlight and eat the nocturnal fruits, spell the writing of the star and the river,
remember what the blood and the tide, the earth and the body say, return to the starting point,
neither inside nor outside, neither up nor down, at the crossroads, where the roads begin,
because the light sings with a murmur of water, with a murmur of foliage the water sings
and the dawn is loaded with fruits, the reconciled day and night flow like a gentle river,
the day and the night caress each other for a long time like a man and a woman in love,
Like a single endless river under arches of centuries the seasons and men flow,
towards, there, to the living center of the origin, beyond end and beginning.

"Duro tormento de mi larga ausencia 
que siempre aflijes la memoria mía, 
¿de qué sirve matarme cada día 
si no me das para morir licencia? 
¿Qué me importa el vivir, si en la paciencia 
hallo que muero con mayor porfía, 
pues morir sin morir es tiranía 
que sólo la ha sufrido mi paciencia? 
De Narcisa gocé los ojos bellos, 
gloria que merecí por largos plazos, 
y ya me miro ausente della y dellos. 
Confirmaron mi amor prendas y lazos, 
mas si los merecí para perdellos, 
¿qué mayor muerte que gozar sus brazos?","Torment of absence and delay, 
That thus afflicts my memory, 
Why do'st thou kill me every day, 
Yet will not give me leave to die? 
Why dost thou suffer me to live? 
All hope of life in life denying? 
Or to my patience tortures give, 
Never to die, yet ever dying? 
To fair Narcissa's brighter eyes, 
I was by love's instruction guided, 
A happiness I long did prize, 
But now am from their light divided. 
Favours and gifts my suit obtained, 
But envious Fate would now destroy them; 
Which if to lose I only gained, 
What greater pain than to enjoy them? ","Hard torment of my long absence
that you always afflict my memory,
what's the point of killing myself every day

I find that I die with greater determination,
because dying without dying is tyranny
that only my patience has suffered?
I enjoyed Narcissa's beautiful eyes,
glory that I deserved for long periods,
and I already look absent from her and them.
Garments and ties confirmed my love,
but if I deserved them to lose them,

"Corre con pies de sonorosa plata 
huyendo de sí mismo un arroyuelo, 
y dando vueltas por el verde suelo, 
con cinta de cristal las flores ata. 
Cruza la selva, y cándido retrata 
cuanto encuentra su líquido desvelo, 
pisa un jazmín, y vistese su yelo, 
axa una flor, y mirase escarlata. 
Así de Clori en líquidas querellas 
bajó, como pintada mariposa, 
un diluvio de lágrimas, o Estrellas: 
tocó las flores de su cara hermosa, 
y como el agua se detuvo en ellas, 
unas veces fue nieve, otras fue rosa.","As when some brook flies from itself away, 
The murmuring crystal loosely runs astray; 
And as about the verdant plain it winds, 
The meadows with a silver riband binds, 
Printing a kiss on every flower she meets, 
Losing herself to fill them with new sweets, 
To scatter frost upon the lily's head, 
And scarlet on the gilliflower to spread:

"Huye sin percibirse, lento, el día,

lleva tras sí la edad lozana mía. 
La vida nueva, que en niñez ardía,

Approach in silence, then like wasted flowers

Were in last winter's discontent entombed, 
And lie between dark shadows and cold snow; 
I did not feel the mute years slip away, 
But now I weep their passing, and I see 
Them mocking at my quickened tears today; 
My penitence masks all desire in me, 
For this deceit's my life as I conceive it, 
While I await the end, and do not believe it. ","The day flees without being perceived, slowly,
and the secret and modest hour
With silence she approaches, and, despised,
He carries behind him my luxuriant age.
The new life, which burned in childhood,
the robust and deceived youth,
buried in the last winter,
lies between black shadow and cold snow.
I did not feel the years slip silently;
Today I cry for them past, and I see them
laughing at my tears and damage.
My penance is due to my desire,
because my deceptions owe me their lives,
And I wait for the evil that happened, and I don't believe him.",,John A. Crow,baroque

The sun drink up the waters newly thawed; 
And on the hills the moaning cattle pawed, 
Their miseries robbed the day of light for me. 
I went into my house; I saw how spotted, 
Decaying things made that old home their prize; 
My withered walking-staff had come to bend.

Forsaken mourns where once it towered sublime;

And feeding still with that should cure disease, 
At once my peace and reputation kill 
By turns; as the conflicting passions fire, 
And chase each other madly through my breast, 
I worship and despise, blame and admire, 
Weep and rejoice, and covet and detest. 
Alas! a bitter bargain he must choose, 
Who live with life, or life with love, must lose! ","When from my confused thought,
foolish love, crazy cases I imagine,
The less I dare, and the more I determine,
that there is plenty of love, and there is a lack of daring.
Unknown to my value, I try
a pilgrim remedy for a grievance;
and encouraging him, I barely guess,
executioner of my infamy the feeling.
Ungrateful oblivion, grateful adore,
I hate cowardly, I love daring,
I call, and I flee, I want, and I do not desire:
I sing my sorrows, and I cry my glories;
How much he lives, or dies repentant,
If I have to lose my life, or my desire!",,Edward Fitzgerald,baroque
"Éstas, que fueron pompa y alegría, 
despertando al albor de la mañana, 
a la tarde serán lástima vana, 
durmiendo en brazos de la noche fría. 
Este matiz, que al cielo desafía, 
iris listado de oro, nieve y grana, 
será escarmiento de la vida humana: 
¡tanto se emprende en término de un día! 
A florecer las rosas madrugaron, 
y para envejecerse florecieron: 
cuna y sepulcro en un botón hallaron. 
Tales los hombres sus fortunas vieron: 
en un día nacieron y expiraron; 
que pasados los siglos, horas fueron. ","These flowers of lordly pomp and joy's sweet breath 
Which at the break of day unfold awaking, 
In the cold arms of night will soon be making 
A piteous wreath for vanity and death. 
This hue that challenges the star-hung sky, 
This iris stained with russet, gold, and snow, 
Teaches what every human heart must know: 
How much of life crowds each day passing by! 
These roses flourish at the touch of dawn, 
But bloom only to wither and grow old, 
Each bud is birth and grave's symbolic pawn: 
So has man felt his brevity foretold; 
Born one day, dead the next, his years unfold, 
And seem but hours when centuries have gone. ","These, which were pomp and joy,
waking up at the dawn of the morning,
in the afternoon they will be vain pity,
sleeping in the arms of the cold night.
This nuance, which defies the sky,
striped iris of gold, snow and scarlet,
It will be a lesson to human life:
so much is undertaken in one day!
The roses rose early to bloom,
and to grow old they flourished:
cradle and tomb in a button they found.
Such men saw their fortunes:
in one day they were born and expired;
that after centuries, hours were.",,John A. Crow,baroque
"Demonio. Ea, infernal abismo, 
desesperado imperio de ti mismo, 
de tu prisión ingrata 
tus lascivos espíritus desata, 
amenazando ruina

De mil torpes fantasmas que en el viento 
su casto pensamiento 
hoy se forme, su honesta fantasía 
se llene; y con dulcísima armonía 
todo provoque amores, 
los pájaros, las plantas y las flores. 
Nada miren sus ojos, 
que no sean de amor dulces despojos; 
nada oigan sus oídos, 
que no sean de amor tiernos gemidos; 
porque sin que defensa en su fe tenga, 
hoy a buscar a Cipriano venga, 
de su ciencia invocada, 
y de mi ciego espíritu guiada. 
Empezad, que yo en tanto 
callaré, porque empiece vuestro canto. (Vase.)

Pesada imaginación, 
al parecer lisonjera, 
¿Cuándo te he dado ocasión

¿Qué dolor el que padece mi sentido?

Aquel ruiseñor amante 
es quien respuesta me da, 
enamorando constante 
a su consorte, que está 
un ramo más adelante. 
Calla, ruiseñor; no aquí 
imaginar me hagas ya, 
por las quejas que te oí, 
cómo un hombre sentirá, 
si siente un pájaro así. 
Mas no: una vid fue lasciva, 
que buscando fugitiva 
va al tronco donde se enlace, 
siendo el verdor con que abrace 
el peso con que derriba. 
No así con verdes abrazos 
me hagas pensar en quien amas, 
vid; que dudaré en tus lazos, 
si así abrazan unas ramas, 
cómo enraman unos brazos. 
Y si no es la vid, será 
aquel girasol, que está 
viendo cara a cara al sol, 
tras cuyo hermoso arrebol 
siempre moviéndose va. 
No sigas, no, tus enojos, 
flor, con marchitos despojos, 
que pensarán mis congojas, 
si así lloran unas hojas, 
cómo lloran unos ojos. 
Cesa, amante ruiseñor; 
desúnete, vid frondosa; 
párate, inconstante flor, 
o decid, ¿qué venenosa 
fuerza usáis? 
Coro (dentro). Amor, amor. ","The Daemon tempts Justina, who is a Christian 
Daemon. Abyss of Hell! I call on thee, 
Thou wild misrule of thine own anarchy! 
From thy prison house set free 
Thy spirits of voluptuous death, 
That with their mighty breath 
They may destroy a world of virgin thoughts; 
Let her chaste mind with fancies thick as motes 
Be peopled from thy shadowy deep, 
Till her guiltless fantasy 
Full to overflowing be! 
And with sweetest harmony, 
Let birds, and flowers, and leaves, and all 
things move 
To love, only to love, 
Let nothing meet her eyes 
But signs of love's soft victories; 
Let nothing meet her ear 
But sounds of love's sweet sorrow, 
So that from faith no succor she may borrow, 
But, guided by my spirit blind 
And in a magic snare entwined, 
She may now seek Ciprian, 
Begin, while I in silence bind 
My voice, when thy sweet song thou hast 
begun. 
One voice, singing within. 
What is the glory far above 
All else in human life? 
All. Love! love! 
While these words are sung, the Daemon goes out at 
one door, and Justina enters at another. 
The voice. There is no form in which the fire 
Of love its traces has impressed not. 
Man lives far more in love's desire 
Than by life's breath, soon possessed not. 
If all that lives must love or die, 
All shapes on earth, or sea, or sky, 
With one consent to heaven cry 
That the glory far above 
All else in life is— 
All. Love! oh, love! 
Thou melancholy thought which art 
So flattering and so sweet, to thee 
When did I give the liberty 
Thus to afflict my heart? 
What is the cause of this new power 
Which doth my fevered being move, 
Momently raging more and more? 
What subtle pain is kindled now 
Which from my heart doth overflow 
Into my senses? 
All. Love! oh, love!  
'Tis that enamored nightingale 
Who gives me the reply; 
He ever tells the same soft tale 
Of passion and of constancy 
To his mate, who rapt and fond, 
Listening sits, a bough beyond. 
Be silent, nightingale—no more 
Make me think, in hearing thee 
Thus tenderly thy love deplore, 
If a bird can feel his so, 
What a man would feel for me. 
And, voluptuous vine, O thou 
Who seekest most when least pursuing, 
To the trunk thou interlacest 
Art the verdure which embracest, 
And the weight which is its ruin— 
No more, with green embraces, vine, 
Make me think on what thou lovest. 
For whilst thus thy boughs entwine, 
I fear lest thou shouldst teach me, sophist, 
How arms might be entangled too. 
Light-enchanted sunflower, thou 
Who gazest ever true and tender 
On the sun's revolving splendor! 
Follow not his faithless glance 
With thy faded countenance, 
Nor teach my beating heart to fear, 
If leaves can mourn without a tear, 
How eyes must weep! O nightingale, 
Cease from thy enamored tale- 
Leafy vine, unwreathe thy bower, 
Restless sunflower, cease to move, 
Or tell me all, what poisonous power 
Ye use against me- 
All. Love! Love! Love! ","Devil. Hey, infernal abyss,

everything provokes love,

Nothing look into your eyes,
May they not be sweet spoils of love;

that in me you grow for moments?
What pain does my sense suffer?

That loving nightingale
is the one who answers me,
falling in love constantly
to his consort, who is
one branch later.
Hush, nightingale; not here
imagine you make me now,
for the complaints I heard from you,
how a man will feel,
if you feel a bird like that.
But no: a vine was lascivious,
looking for a fugitive
goes to the trunk where it is linked,
being the greenery with which I embrace
the weight with which he knocks down.
Not so with green hugs
make me think about who you love,
vine; that I will doubt in your ties,
If they hug some branches like this,
how arms reach out.
And if it is not the vine, it will be
that sunflower, which is
looking face to face to the sun,
behind whose beautiful bloom
always moving goes.
Do not continue, no, your anger,
flower, with withered remains,
What will my sorrows think?
If some leaves cry like that,
how eyes cry.

Break away, leafy vine;

With flowery loveliness so rare 
Naught but His kisses could have nursed them there. 
How many, many days have I explored 
The grove; and flower on flower, herb on herb, 
Scented and tasted! Yea, without reward- 
My heart a burden that my pains perturb, 
My step a draggled vagabond, -to rove 
Through Time turned centuries, and worlds a grove!","Searching for Narcissus tired

to have news of my lost Good;
that if you sign I confirm,
saying what is flowery about the meadow,
to produce so many amenities
It is because I have already kissed His soles.

To fix the blame on woman's reason,

While to ill alone you fire. 
Her resistance you oppose, 
Then, all serious, attaint her; 
Fickle, light and faithless paint her,

If the one who is ungrateful offends,
And what is easy, does it make you angry?
But, between anger and sorrow

well there is the one who doesn't love you,

Your lovers give sorrow
to your freedoms wings,
and after doing them bad

in a wrong passion:
the one who falls by prayer,
or the one who prays when fallen?
Or which is more to blame,

the one who sins for pay,
or the one who pays for sinning?
Well, why are you scared?
of the guilt you have?
Want them, which one do you make them?
or make them whatever you are looking for.
Stop requesting
